The Atlantic Ocean has only one species, the Atlantic salmon\\n_(Salmo salar),_ while in the Pacific Ocean there are several species\\nincluding Pink _(Oncorhynchus gorbuscha_), Chum _(O. keta)_ , Sockeye _(O.\\nnerka_), Coho _(O. kisutch_), Chinook _(O. tschawytscha_) and Amago _(O.\\nrhodurus_).\\n\\n## **Life Cycle of Atlantic Salmon**\\n\\nIrish salmon are Atlantic salmon and spend their juvenile phase in rivers\\nbefore migrating to sea to grow and mature. To complete their life cycle they\\nmust return to their river of origin to spawn. The salmon who adopt this life\\ncycle are called anadromous.\\n\\n### **Life begins**\\n\\nThe salmon starts life as a small pea sized egg hidden away under loose gravel\\nin cool clean rivers entering the North Atlantic Ocean. Against the odds the\\nparents of this little egg have succeeded in returning to freshwater to spawn\\ncompleting their life cycle before giving rise to a new generation. To do this\\nboth male and female adults ceased to feed on entering freshwater in response\\nto gonadal development, directing all their energy instead to reproduction.\\nThe migration of adults in winter to suitable habitat can commence up to a\\nyear before spawning takes place. Spawning typically occurs in headwaters,\\nthough it may happen anywhere in a river if a suitable substrate of well\\noxygenated loose gravel is available. At spawning time (November to January),\\nthe female digs a depression in the gravel with her tail to deposit her eggs.\\nOne or more males discharge milt over the falling eggs to fertilize. Quickly\\nthe female covers the eggs with gravel to a depth of several centimetres which\\nforms a nest or \"redd\" on the river bed. Buried deep inside the gravel the ova\\nare safe from the impact of debris carried along in heavy floods and from\\nattack by predators such as eels (_Anguilla anguilla_), trout (_Salmo trutta_)\\nor cormorants (_Phalacrocorax carbo)_.\\n\\n### **Ova**\\n\\nThe rate of egg or \"ova\" development is dependent on water temperature. Eyes\\ninside the pea sized orange ova are visible and increasing movement can be\\ndetected as the yolk sac containing food is consumed. The number of ova\\ndeposited in the redd is determined by the size of the female with larger\\nfemales over 10kg depositing 15,000 each. This high fecundity (ova per female)\\nis critical as survival in the wild is extremely low, especially in\\nfreshwater. For example, in the Burrishoole River on the west coast of Ireland\\nsurvival rates for juveniles from 1970 to 2015 was as low as 0.3% in 2001\\nrising to a high of just 1.3% in 2007.\\n\\n### **Alevins**\\n\\nThe just-hatched fish are called \"alevins\" and still have the yolk sac\\nattached to their bodies in Spring. When their yolk sac is absorbed the\\nalevins become increasingly active and begin their journey up through the\\ngravel of the riverbed. When strong enough the small fish must rise to the\\nsurface of the water and gulp air. By doing this they fill their swim bladder\\nto gain neutral buoyancy making it easier to swim and hold their position in\\nfast flowing streams. This critical period is therefore referred to as \"swim-\\nup\" and exposes the young to dangerous predators for the first time. Once they\\nbegin to swim freely they are called fry.\\n\\n### **Fry**\\n\\nThe fry have eight fins, which are used to maintain their position in fast\\nflowing streams and manoeuvre about in the water during the Summer months. Fry\\nfeed on microscopic invertebrates and their abundance is regulated by\\ntemperature, predation, pollution and competition for food with other fry and\\nother species of fish. The presence of salmon in a river is synonymous with a\\nhealthy aquatic environment, and as they are extremely sensitive to changes in\\nwater quality, habitat and climate, salmon are a good indicator of freshwater\\nand marine ecosystem status.\\n\\n### **Parr**\\n\\nOver the Autumn the fry develop into parr with vertical stripes and spots for\\ncamouflage. They feed on aquatic insects and continue to grow for one to three\\nyears while maintaining their territory in the stream. Once the parr have\\ngrown to between 10 and 25cm in body length, they undergo a physiological pre-\\nadaptation to life in seawater by smolting. This is evident by changes in\\ntheir appearance as they become silvery and swim with the current instead of\\nagainst it. There are also internal changes in the salt-regulating mechanisms\\nof the fish. This adaptation prepares the smolt for its journey to the ocean.\\n\\n### **Smolt**\\n\\nIn Spring, large numbers of smolts 1-3 years old, leave Irish rivers to\\nmigrate along the North Atlantic Drift, and into the rich feeding grounds of\\nthe Norwegian Sea and the greater expanse of the North Atlantic Ocean. Here\\nthey feed primarily on fish such as capelin _(Mallotus villosus)_ , herring\\n_(Alosa spp.)_ , and sand eel _(_ Ammodytes spp _.)_. As they grow quickly\\nfewer predators are able to feed on them. Their rate of growth is therefore\\ncritical to survival.\\n\\n**Adult Salmon**\\n\\nSalmon that reach maturity after one year at sea are called Grilse; these\\nreturn to their river in summer weighing from 0.8 to 4kg. If it takes two or\\nmore years at sea to mature the salmon will return considerably earlier in the\\nyear and larger at 3 to 15kg, and because of their size they are greatly\\nsought after by fishermen. Salmon exhibit remarkable \"homing instinct\" with a\\nvery high proportion able to locate their river of origin using the earth\\'s\\nmagnetic field, the chemical smell of their river and pheromones (chemical\\nsubstances released by other salmon in the river). Perfect homing precision is\\nexpected even after migrations over 3,000km to feeding grounds north of the\\nArctic Circle in the Norwegian Sea and at West Greenland. There is great\\nexcitement when adult salmon return to rivers as many are seen leaping\\nacrobatically into the air and jumping over waterfalls while moving upstream.\\nSalmon that survive fishermen, poachers and pollution may still have to scale\\nlarge dams built across rivers before eventually finding refuge in lakes and\\ndeep pools. Arriving upstream on their spawning grounds among big boulders in\\nicy headwaters the life cycle begins again, so ensuring survival of the\\nspecies for another generation.\\n\\n### **Kelts**\\n\\nHaving spawned, the salmon are referred to as \"kelts\". Weak from not eating\\nsince arriving in freshwater and losing energy in a bid to reproduce\\nsuccessfully, kelts are susceptible to disease and predators. Mortality after\\nspawning can be significant, especially for males but some do survive and\\ncommence their epic journey again. Scientists studying salmon initially used\\nthe rings laid down on scales, much like tree rings, to determine the age and\\ngrowth of salmon in freshwater and at sea. By doing this they established that\\nsome kelts succeeded in spawning three times! Now a new record exists of an\\nIrish salmon that reached maturity after less than one year at sea - a zero\\nsea winter salmon. The salmon left the Bundorragha River in Co. Mayo on the\\n27/04/2007 as a 1 year old smolt of 49g only to return from the sea on the\\n05/11/2007 at 810g.\\n\\n#### **Zero Sea Winter Salmon Scale**\\n\\n****\\n\\nScientists today have a greater array of techniques to study the complex life\\ncycle of this important species. Tagging, tracking, use of DNA and Stable\\nIsotope Analysis in association with habitat and climate change studies are\\nongoing in a bid to understand the factors that govern the survival of this\\nspecies. The climate change canary of the North Atlantic moves easily from\\nfreshwater to roam the North Atlantic Ocean feeding constantly on migration\\nwhile avoiding predators, then homes to their natal river, jumping over almost\\nimpassable falls to reach their exact place of birth. Surviving impossible\\nodds makes salmon _Salmo salar_ the \"King of Fish\".\\n\\n  '),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.oceansatlas.org/subtopic/en/c/1303/', 'title': 'UN Atlas of the Oceans: Subtopic', 'language': 'No language found.'}, page_content='\\n'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.ontario.ca/page/fish-tags#:~:text=A%20fish%20tag%20is%20a,fish%20(known%20as%20internal%20tags)', 'title': 'Fish tags | ontario.ca', 'description': 'Learn about fish tags, fish tag research and what to do if you catch a tagged fish.

Biologists or\\nresearchers can pick up the signal by tracking fish in the field or by using\\nstationary receivers located in the environment near the fish (Figure 1). The\\ndata from the signals can provide more detailed information on fish movement\\nand habitat use, which is difficult to get from external tags.\\n\\nImage\\n\\n**Figure 1:** Examples of a) a biologist actively tracking fish movement using\\na radio antenna and b) a stationary acoustic receiver on the lake bottom.\\n\\nWe have tagged many fish species in watersheds across Ontario.

They will generally tag\\nor mark aquatic animals to obtain important information necessary for research\\nor management. By reporting tagged or marked fish (i.e. a recapture), you can\\nassist in:\\n\\n1- Stock identification -determining whether stocks or sub-populations are\\nconnected and are being utilized for sport or commercial fisheries\\n\\n2- Migrations - figuring out the path and distance of migration, rate of\\nmovement, and homing tendencies of a particular species\\n\\n3- Behaviour - identifying factors that limit abundance such as habitat\\nselection and intra- and inter-species interactions\\n\\n4- Age - validating the age of fish, particularly for aging methods (e.g.\\ncounting growth rings on a scale) and determining growth rates\\n\\n5- Mortality rates - following the effects of natural and fishing mortality on\\na fish population\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## **WHAT FISH ARE ELIGIBLE FOR TAGGING?**\\n\\nThe ORI-CFTP is strictly a marine based project. This means we do not tag\\nfreshwater fish species, although we do tag fish in estuarine environments. A\\nlarge variety of species are eligible to be tagged as part of the project,\\nalthough fish less than 30 cm (0.5 kg) are not tagged. Please download the\\nlatest priority species list. There are many different types of tags used on\\ndifferent fish species (e.g. satellite tags, acoustic tags, archival tags,\\netc.). The ORI-CFTP use external dart tags, which consist of a monofilament\\nvinyl streamer attached to a plastic barb, much like a miniature version of a\\nspear from a speargun. Each tag is inscribed with a unique alpha-numeric code\\n(e.g. D123456) and contact details (i.e. email address, cell phone number and\\npostal address).\\n\\nTags are generally inserted with a sharp, hollow, stainless steel applicator,\\ninto the dorsal musculature of a fish or shark, although this may differ in\\ncertain fish species (e.g. rays). There are three types of tags used on the\\nORI-CFTP. These include A-tag (sharks and rays and large bony fish >60cm),\\nD-tags (smaller bony fish between 30 and 60 cm in length) and M-tags (billfish\\nand large tuna >25 kg). Tags are generally inserted with a sharp, hollow,\\nstainless steel applicator, into the dorsal musculature of a fish or shark,\\nalthough this may differ in certain fish species (e.g. rays). Upon initial\\ntagging (and subsequent recapture of a tagged fish) anglers record the\\nfollowing information: tag number, fish species, length\\n(fork/total/precaudal/disk width), exact locality and date. The use of\\nexternal tags by the ORI-CFTP is particularly favourable as it is relatively\\ncheap compared to other tagging methods, relatively little training is\\nrequired to insert tags, no software is required to download information from\\neach tag, and the tagging equipment is very basic. This allows a relatively\\nlarge number of fish to be tagged fairly economically and allows citizens who\\nare not trained scientists to be involved, similar in some respects to the\\nSouth African Bird Ringing Unit. However, considerable attention has been\\nfocused on ensuring that the best available tag and tagging equipment is used\\nand that our taggers are shown how to handle and tag fish correctly, in order\\nto minimize post-release mortality.\\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\n## **HOW TO BECOME A MEMBER**\\n\\nIf you are interested in making a significant contribution to conservation and\\nmanagement of our marine linefish species, live near the coast, fish often and\\nknow your different fish species then please complete an application form to\\napply to become a member of the ORI-CFTP. An email will be sent to you once\\nyour application has been submitted. You will be notified if your application\\nis successful and will be required to purchase a starter kit with everything\\nyou need, including instruction manual, tape measure and tagging equipment\\n(dart tags and applicator).\\n\\n## **HOW TO TAG FISH**\\n\\nIf you are interested in learning how to handle and tag fish correctly please\\nconsult the following material. If you follow these guides you will be on your\\nway to successful tag and release.\\n\\n  * Instructional manual\\n  * How to tag bony fish using a dart tag\\n  * How to tag a shark using a dart tag\\n  * How to tag a stingray/skate using a dart tag\\n  * How to measure fish correctly\\n  * How to correctly record information on a tag card\\n  * Priority species list\\n  * Responsible angling guidelines\\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\n**WHAT IS A TAG RECAPTURE?**\\n\\nA tag recapture is a fish that has been caught with a tag in place. One of the\\nmajor problems faced by the ORI-CFTP is the low reporting rate for the\\nrecapture of tagged fish. An in depth study of 1200 shore and boat anglers\\nfrom KwaZulu-Natal in 2009 revealed that 42% of anglers that had caught a\\ntagged fish had simply released the fish without recording the tag number or\\nhad simply not bothered to report it. Obviously this low reporting rate is not\\nideal for the ORI-CFTP. Consequently we have developed a number of initiatives\\nto help increase this reporting rate. These include a dedicated email address\\n(oritag@ori.org.za), cell phone number (+27 79 529 0711) and an online\\nsubmission form.\\n\\nRemember that a tagged fish does not “belong” to anyone and should it be\\nrecaptured, the angler who caught it is fully entitled to keep it, so long as\\nit complies with the relevant fishery regulations. However, it is crucially\\nimportant that when an angler catches a tagged fish he/she reports the\\nrelevant information promptly and correctly to ORI. Valuable information is\\noften lost with the delayed reporting of the recapture as well as the\\nincorrect reading of a tag number or poor measurement of the fish length.\\n\\n**Tag number** \\\\- this is the number (in most cases 6 digits) on the tag as\\nwell as the tag type (a letter before the tag number) - e.g. D132526 or\\nA142576. It is not advisable to remove the tag if you are going to release the\\nfish again; rather carefully read the tag number (ask someone to verify this\\nnumber if possible), measure the fish, write down this information and then\\nre-release the fish. If it is not possible to read the tag number then cut the\\nback number off the tag just behind the email address. Make sure that you have\\nthe tag type (A, B, D, or M) and the numbers (up to 6 digits) on the section\\nof tag you have cut off. Remember, if you don’t have a pen or pencil, you can\\nrecord the details on your cell phone (or take a photo of it).\\n\\n  \\n\\n**Species** \\\\- this is the species/type of fish you have recaptured. If you\\nare not sure what species it is, write down what you think it is followed by a\\n“?” and give us a brief description or if possible take a photograph. Some\\nspecies have many common names which can be confusing. Please use the accepted\\ncommon name in full (e.g. spotted grunter, not just grunter as there are a\\nnumber of different grunter species).\\n\\n**Correct length measurement** \\\\- It is essential that we receive correct\\nmeasurements from you. If you do not have a tape measure use a piece of nylon\\nor string to measure the fish with, marking it with a knot at the correct\\nlength. When measuring a fish do not lie the tape measure/string over the body\\nbut rather hold it under the fish or in as straight a line as possible.\\nIndicate on the return what measurement type was taken (i.e. fork length,\\ntotal length, precaudal length or disk width).\\n\\nFor accuracy we require our tagging members to measure fork length if the fish\\nhas a forked tail (e.g. kingfish), total length if it has a straight or\\nrounded tail (e.g. kob, rockcod), precaudal length if it is a shark with a\\nprecaudal notch (e.g. dusky shark), or disk width (wing span) if it is a ray.\\nTotal length should be measured for spotted-gulley sharks, hound sharks, cat\\nsharks and sand sharks. If you are uncertain about which length type to\\nmeasure, then simply measure more than one (e.g. fork length and total length\\nor precaudal length and total length). Remember, length measurements for\\nminimum legal size limits are always total length.\\n\\n  \\n\\n**Exact locality** \\\\- this is the exact area where you caught your tagged\\nfish. This needs to be quite specific and always state the province and or\\nmajor river/town in the vicinity to ensure that we know exactly where you were\\nfishing. Our coastline extends 3000 km and many of the fishing spots have the\\nsame name or many different names. A geographic coordinate (i.e. GPS point) is\\nnot necessary but if you have recorded them please provide one.\\n\\n**Date** \\\\- this is the date of recapture. Please use the standard format\\n**YYYY/MM/DD**.\\n\\n**Whether the fish was kept or released** \\\\- this is important as if the fish\\nwas re-released was the tag left in the fish or removed? A fish that has a tag\\nin it should never be retagged unless the original tag was removed.\\n\\n**Angler name and contact details** \\\\- Supply us with your name, email address\\nand phone number in case more information is needed. We send out an exciting,\\ndetailed report on recaptured fish to the angler who caught it and sent us the\\ninformation. Remember that the more accurate your information is the better\\nthe report will be.\\n\\n## **WHAT IS A TAG RECAPTURE?**\\n\\n**Fish is tagged and released**\\n\\n**Fish spends time at liberty**\\n\\n**Tagged fish is recaptured**\\n\\n**Recapture details recorded by angler**  \\nAfter details are recorded, fish is either released or kept\\n\\n**Recapture details sent to ORI**\\n\\n**Recapture report generated by ORI**  \\nOriginal tagger and angler who recaptured the fish are notified by email and\\nprovided with movement and growth details.\\n\\n'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fm-gp/salmon-saumon/comm-gear-engin-eng.html', 'title': 'Commercial salmon gear types| Pacific Region | Fisheries and Oceans Canada', 'description': 'Commercial salmon gear types | Pacific Region | Fisheries and Oceans Canada', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='nd finances\\n  * Science and innovation\\n\\n## You are here:\\n\\n  1.

Nets are set in a circle around aggregations of fish. The bottom edges\\nof the net are then drawn together into a \"purse\" to prevent escape of the\\nfish. Seiners take approximately 50% of the commercial catch.\\n\\nSeiner\\n\\nSeine nets\\n\\n**Salmon gill nets** are rectangular nets that hang in the water and are set\\nfrom either the stern or bow of the vessel. Fish swim headfirst into the net,\\nentangling their gills in the mesh.

Gill netters generally fish near coastal rivers and inlets,\\ntaking about 25% of the commercial catch.\\n\\nGill net vessel\\n\\nGill net\\n\\n**Trollers** employ hooks and lines which are suspended from large poles\\nextending from the fishing vessel.

The demand of fish and marine product have increased significantly throughout the \\nyear. Therefore, overfishing had become major concern for various parties around the world especially the United Nation(UN). Collecting numerical data is a first step toward preservation and conservation of tuna and other fish populati on. This paper reviews automatic tuna length \\nmeasurement by using machine vision techniques. This is one of the steps in collecting necessary data on size of fishes caught by fishermen. Previous research had been done on measuring the \\nlength of fish, but the accuracy rate of the length measurement is not satisfactory enough. Many \\nfactors affecting the accuracy of the length measurement processes such as lighting inequalities, \\nblood on the platform and others.

Introduction \\nThe fisheries sector is one of the most important f ood sources throughout the world. Due to growth of \\nhuman population, tones of fish have been catch throughout human history. Currently, overfishing has been a great concern due to the rapidly shrinking population of fish especially tuna. This issue is taken \\nseriously by various parties including the United Nation Organization (UN). By 2020, the Sustainable \\nDevelopment Goals, a target from UN want to effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, \\nillegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-\\nbased management plans, in order to restore fish stoc ks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels \\nthat can produce maximum sustainable yield as dete rmined by their biological characteristics [1]. \\nAccording to statistical data reported by Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Agriculture Malaysia, \\nfish production in Malaysia increased from 2005 to 20 17 with latest marine fish catches proportion are \\n1.46 million tons of fish in 2017. To avoid fish extinction, Malaysia government enforce Malaysian tuna fishermen to measure and record each catch’s length and weight they caught. This enforcement is one of the government effort to preserve and sustain wild tuna stock in the ocean. Usually, tuna fishermen \\nwill measure their catch by using a measuring tape  and weighing scale. This current method took the \\nlongest time and effort. To tackle this problem, several machine vision techniques had been proposed \\nby researchers. Machine vision is the technology and techniques used to provide imaging-based \\nautomatic inspection and analysis.

The machine vision \\ntechnology can help fishermen to obtain the length information of that would overcome the limitation \\nof the traditional methods as well as reducing the labor cost [2,3]. Criteria of this review is the accuracy \\nof length measurement. Fish point identification w ill be discussed in section 2.1. then we discuss the \\nlength measurement method in section 2.2. \\n2.  Fish Length Measurement \\nFish length is one of the parameters of measuremen t needed to record the tuna’s data. This section \\ndiscusses automatic tuna length measurement from a 2D image. There are two steps of automatic tuna \\nlength measurement process which are; fish’s snout and tail point identification (FSATPI), and length \\nmeasurement method. Fish used in this review are tuna and the tuna will be treated as a linear measurement because the body of the fish is regarded as a straight line and not curve. Several types of fish length have been identified but the common length measurement used for tuna is fork length as in figure 1. \\n \\nFigure 1.  Different types of fish's length measurement. \\n2.1.  Fish Points Identification  \\nPast studies report on the method used to FSATPI . FSATPI play a major role on automatic length \\nmeasurement. Without points identification, the length measurement cannot be done. Several methods are used for point identification such as; estimation by human eyes[3], Hsiu method[6], and Truss Morphometric Network (TMN) [8]. Estimation by human eyes were compared in several studies. From Table 1, human eyes are used to point the fish snout and tail before the points are used by the machine \\nto automatically measure the fish length [3]. However, human eyes cannot be reliable on a long time \\ntask due to fatigue. There are result show approximately 10% of error [5]. While, Hsiu method[6] used \\nin point identification has error rate less than 2.19%. \\nSimultaneously, TMN can also identify the fish snout and tail point. TMN constructed with the help \\nof landmark points are one of the tools for fish body identification. Truss length measured between these \\nlandmark points should either lie on curved surfaces or  be on straight lines lying on a flat plane[8]. \\nFigure 2 show TMN constructed on a bluefin tuna body. \\n \\nFigure 2.

Length Measurement Method  \\nWhen the point of fish snout and tail have been identified, the length of the fish can be measured. The fish length can be calculated by using the relation of fish body pixel length and the image reference \\nscale. The reference scale can be obtained through a square on the color plate. Currently, the widely \\nused method used by fishermen are estimating by human eyes and measuring tape. However, estimation \\nby human eyes is a hard labor job and concentration for a long time is needed. Less than 10% of error \\nwas shown by estimation by human eyes. From Table 2,  Hough transform used by Hsieh [3] shown the \\nerror of measuring the length of tuna was less than 5%. But, the accuracy of the Hough transform method \\ncan be increased by using projective transform to reposition the referenc e plate before length \\nmeasurement was calculated. \\nWhile, image thinning used by Jun showed a measurement error of less than 3% [9] as shown in \\nTable 2. Man show that the Hsiu method used for measuring fish length where resulted less than 3% of \\nmeasurement error [6]. Unfortunately, there were no past researches yet have been done to a bigger fish such as tuna because of the distance of targeted object and camera, and the angle of the targeted object and camera needed to be recorded for this method to calculated the length measurement of tuna [6]. The tuna caught by fishermen will be put into the freezer as fast as possible to retain the freshness of the fish \\nand this will be a hindrance for researcher to record every single angle pf the fish during the photo taken by the camera. \\nBest fitting rectangle used by Hao for measuring fish length where resulted less than 0.5% of \\nmeasurement error [2] as shown in Table 2. Unfortunately, same with Hsiu method, this method not yet \\nbeen research on tuna fish which is much bigger than fish use in the research and tuna fin structure cause \\na significant factor of error for this method as best  fitting rectangle always measure the total length of \\nfish rather than fork length which are intended fo r measuring the length of a tuna. Though, the length \\nmeasurement result may vary due to the different size of the subject [2]. \\nGrade-3 polynomial regression method was used by Torres for measuring tuna where resulted less \\nthan 4% of measurement error [7] as shown in Table 2. Regression used in many research as it one of the simplest method used to measure the length of the object. Nevertheless, no research had been done yet to a bigger fish by using this method.

Discussions \\nAutomation of the tuna length measurement process is important because it will make the length \\nmeasurement more accurate and faster compare to manual measurement. Thus, it is important to make \\nthe measurement process automatic to increase the efficiency of the measurement process and increase the effectiveness of tuna catch regulation. \\nThere are other features that need to take into consideration in measuring tuna length using machine \\nvision such as the visual perspective of the object, the angle of the camera to the object, and the distance between the camera and the object. The angle of the camera is very important as it will greatly affect the visual perspective of the object [3]. There are study had been made by taking in the one of the features for fish length measurement method [6,11] but no research had been done yet by using all of \\nthe features for fish length measurement method by  considering all of the measurement environment \\nfactor. Usage of lightbox have higher accuracy in measuring the length of other smaller fish [2] but the \\ndisadvantage of using lightbox is it cannot fit the tuna  body as tuna body is too big to be fit into the \\nlightbox. There were a number of researches had been done with smaller fish species, but they were not \\nyet tested on tuna fish [8]. \\nAlthough the length measurement result has a low error rate, it is still not satisfactory. More research \\nneeded to be done in order to increase the accura cy rate of fish length measurement. Based on [2], \\nalthough the method can be used on both smaller and bigger fish, the result of the length measurement very different from each other.  \\n  '),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Salmon domain/Fish_length.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='\\n5 \\n   \\n \\n \\n4.  Conclusions \\nProblems such as image noise, lighting inequalities  and poor contrast are obstacles to implementing \\neffective and accurate machine vision techniques. Besides, there are factors that can affect the machine \\nvision process such as blood stain on the reference plate, blood stain on the fish body and position of \\nthe fish. The approach of single image camera imaging system in a controlled environment was expected \\nto improve image capture conditions, as backlighting techniques. Furthermore, segmenting fish before \\nmeasurement made is a must do process as it eliminates foreign image noise and uncontrolled setting.  \\nAs for fish measurement, the fish was assumed to be positioned along the x-axis of the environment \\nsetup. The result from previous research shows that a relatively simple method such as polynomial regression can be used for calculating the fish length with remarkable accuracy [7]. \\n5.

Other closely related fish in the same family include\\ntrout, char, grayling, whitefish, lenok and taimen, all coldwater fish of the subarctic and cooler temperate regions\\nwith some sporadic endorheic popul ations in Central Asia.\\nSalmon are typically anadromous: they hatch in the shallow gravel beds of freshwater headstreams and spend their\\njuvenile years in rivers, lakes and freshwater wetlands, migrate to the ocean as adults and live like sea fish, then\\nreturn to their freshwater birthplace to reproduc e. However, popul ations of several species are restricted to fresh\\nwaters (i.e. landlocked) throughout  their lives. Folklore has it that the fish return to the exact stream where they\\nthemselves hatched to spawn, and tracking studies have shown this to be mostly true. A portion of a returning\\nsalmon run may stray and spawn in different freshwater systems; the percent of straying depends on the species of\\nsalmon.[1] Homing be havior has been shown to depend on olfactory memory.[2][3]\\nSalmon are important food fish and are intensively farmed in many parts of the world,[4] with Norway being the\\nworld\\'s largest produc er of farmed salmon, followed by Chile.[5] They are also highly prized game fish for\\nrecreational fishing, by both freshwater and saltwater anglers. Many species of salmon have since been introduc ed\\nand naturalized into non-native environments such as the Great Lakes of North America, Patagonia in South\\nAmerica and South Island of New Zealand.[6]\\nThe Modern English term salmon is derived from Middle English: samoun, samon and saumon, which in turn are\\nfrom Anglo-Norman: saumon, from Old French: saumon, and from Latin: salmō (which in turn might have\\noriginated from salire, meaning \"to leap\".[7]). The unpronounc ed \"l\" absent from Middle English was later added\\nas a Latinisation to make the word closer to its Latin root.

Within Salmo, the Adriatic salmon (Salmo\\nobtusirostris) and Black Sea salmon (Salmo labrax) have both been named as salmon in English, although they fall outside the generally recognized seven salmon species. The\\nmasu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) is actually considered a trout (\"cherry trout\") in Japan, with masu actually being the Japanese word for trout. On the other hand, the\\nsteelhead and sea trout, the anadromous forms of rainbow trout and brown trout respectively, are from the same genera as salmon and live identical migratory lives, but\\nneither is termed \"salmon\" .\\nThe extinct Eosalmo driftwoode nsis, the oldest know n Salmoninae fish in the fossil record, helps scientists figure how the different species of salmon\\ndiverged from a common ancestor. The Eocene salmon\\'s fossil from British Columbia provides evidence that the divergence between Pacific and Atlantic\\nsalmon had not yet occurred 40 million years ago. Both the fossil record and analysis of mitochondr ial DNA suggest the divergence occurred 10 to 20\\nmillion years ago during the Miocene. This independent evidence from DNA analysis and the fossil record indicate that salmon divergence occurred long\\nbefore the Quaternary glaciation began the cycle of glacial advance and retreat.[33]\\nThere are several other species of fish which are colloquially called \"salmon\" but are not true salmon.

A landlocked subspecies known as the Taiwanese salmon or Formosan salmon (Oncorhynchus masou\\nformosanus) is found in central Taiwan\\'s Chi Chia Wan Stream.[50]\\nPink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), known as humpback salmon or \"humpies\" in southeast and southwest Alaska, are found in the\\nwestern Pacific from Lena River in Siberia to Korea, found throughout northern Pacific, and in the eastern Pacific from the Mackenzie\\nRiver in Canada[46] to northern California, usually in shorter coastal streams. It is the smallest of the Pacific species, with an average\\nweight of 1.6 to 1.8 kg (3.5 to 4.0 lb).[51]\\nSockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) is also known as red salmon in the US (especially Alaska).[52] This lake-rearing species is found\\nin the eastern Pacific from Bathurst Inlet in the Canadian Arctic to Klamath River in California, and in the western Pacific from the Anadyr\\nRiver in Siberia to northern Hokkaidō island in Japan. Although most adult Pacific salmon feed on small fish, shrimp, and squid, sockeye\\nfeed on plankton they filter through gill rakers.[53] Kokanee salmon are the landlocked form of sockeye salmon.\\nDanube salmon, or huchen (Hucho hucho), are the largest permanent freshwater salmonid species.\\nSalmon eggs are laid in freshwater streams typically at high latitudes. The eggs hatch into alevin or sac fry. The fry\\nquickly develop into parr with camouflaging vertical stripes. The parr stay for six months to three years in their natal\\nstream before becoming smolts, which are distinguished by their bright, silvery colour with scales that are easily\\nrubbe d off. Only 10%  of all salmon eggs are estimated to survive to this stage.[54]\\nThe smolt body chemistry changes, allowing them to live in salt water. While a few species of salmon remain in fresh\\nwater throughout  their life cycle, the majority are anadromous and migrate to the ocean for maturation: in these\\nspecies, smolts spend a portion of their out-migration time in brackish water, where their body chemistry becomes\\naccustomed to osmoregulation in the ocean.

The adult salmon then return primarily to their natal streams to spawn. Atlantic salmon spend between one\\nand four years at sea. When a fish returns after just one year\\'s sea feeding, it is called a grilse in Canada, Britain, and Ireland.\\nGrilse may be present at spawning, a nd go unnot iced by l arge males, releasing their own sperm on the eggs.[57]\\nPrior to spawning, depending on the species, salmon unde rgo changes. They may grow a hump, develop canine-like teeth, or\\ndevelop a kype  (a pronou nced curvature of the jaws in male salmon). All change from the silvery blue of a fresh-run fish from\\nthe sea to a darker colour. Salmon can make amazing journeys, sometimes moving hundr eds of miles upstream against strong\\ncurrents and rapids to reproduc e. Chinook and sockeye salmon from central Idaho, for example, travel over 1,400 km\\n(900 mi) and climb nearly 2,100 m (7,000 ft) from the Pacific Ocean as they return to spawn. Condition tends to deteriorate\\nthe longer the fish remain in fresh water, and they then deteriorate further after they spawn, when they are know n as kelts. In\\nall species of Pacific salmon, the mature individuals die within a few days or weeks of spawning, a trait know n as semelparity.\\nBetween 2 and 4% of Atlantic salmon kelts survive to spawn again, all females. However, even in those species of salmon that\\nmay survive to spawn more than onc e (iteroparity), pos tspawning m ortality is quite high (perhaps as high as 40 to 50% ).\\nTo lay her roe, the female salmon uses her tail (caudal fin), to create a low-pressure\\nzone, lifting gravel to be swept downstream, excavating a shallow depression, called a\\nredd. The redd may sometimes contain 5,000 eggs covering 2.8 m2 (30 sq ft).[58] The\\neggs usually range from orange to red. One or more males approach the female in her\\nredd, depositing sperm, or milt, over the roe.[53] The female then covers the eggs by\\ndisturbing the gravel at the upstream edge of the depression before moving on to make\\nanother redd. The female may make as many as seven redds before her supply of eggs\\nis exhausted.[53]\\nEach year, the fish experiences a period of rapid growth, often in summer, and one of\\nslower growth, normally in winter. This results in ring formation around an earbone\\ncalled the otolith (annuli), analogous  to the growth rings visible in a tree trunk. Freshwater growth shows as densely crowded\\nrings, sea growth as widely spaced rings; spawning is marked by significant erosion as body mass is conve rted into eggs and\\nmilt.\\nFreshwater streams and estuaries provide important habitat for many salmon species. They feed on terrestrial and aquatic\\ninsects, amphipods, and other crustaceans while young, and primarily on other fish when older. Eggs are laid in deeper water\\nwith larger gravel and need cool water and good water flow (to supply oxyge n) to the developing embryos. Mortality of\\nsalmon in the early life stages is usually high due to natural predation and human-induc ed changes in habitat, such as siltation, high water temperatures, low\\noxyge n concentration, loss of stream cover, and reductions in river flow. Estuaries and their associated wetlands provide vital nursery areas for the salmon\\nprior to their departure to the open ocean. Wetlands not only help buffer the estuary from silt and pollutants, but also provide important feeding and hiding\\nareas.\\nSalmon not killed by other means show greatly accelerated deterioration (phenoptosis, or \"programmed aging\") at the end of their lives.

Salmon fry predominantly feed upon zooplanktons until they reach\\nfingerling sizes, when they start to consume more aquatic invertebrates such as insect larvae, microcrustaceans and worms. As juveniles (parrs), they become\\nmore predatory and actively prey upon aquatic insects, small crustaceans, tadpoles and small bait fishes. They are also know n to breach the water to attack\\nterrestrial insects such as grasshoppe rs and dragonflies,[59] as well as consuming fish eggs (even those of other salmon).\\nAs adults, salmon behave like other mid-sized pelagic fish, eating a variety of sea creatures including smaller forage fish such as lanternfish, herrings, sand\\nlances, mackerels and barracudina. They also eat krill, squid and polychaete worms.[60]\\nIn the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, salmon are keystone species.[61] The migration of salmon represent a massive\\nretrograde nutrient transfer, rich in nitrogen, sulfur, carbon and phos phorus, from the ocean to the inland freshwater\\necosystems. Predation by piscivorous land animals (such as ospreys, bears and otters) along the journey serve to\\ntransfer the nutrients from the water to land, a nd decomposition of salmon carcass benefits the forest ecosystem.\\nIn the case of Pacific salmon, most (if not all) of the salmon that survive to reach the headwater spawning grounds\\nwill die after laying eggs and their dead bodies sink to cover the gravel beds, with the nutrients released from the\\nbiodegradation of their corpses providing a significant boos t to these otherwise biomass-poor shallow streams.\\nGrizzly bears function as ecosystem engineers, capturing salmon and carrying them into adjacent dry land to eat the\\nfish. There they deposit nutrient-rich urine and feces and partially eaten carcasses. Bears preparing for hibernation tend to preferentially consume the more\\nnutrient- and energy-rich salmon roes and brain over the actual flesh,[62] and are estimated to discard up to half the salmon they've harvested uneaten on the\\nforest floor,[63][64] in densities that can reach 4,000 kg (8,800 lb) per hectare,[65] providing as much as 24% of the total nitrogen available to the riparian\\nwoodlands. The foliage of spruce trees up to 500 m (1,600 ft) from a stream where grizzlies fish salmon have been found to contain nitrogen originating from\\nthe fished salmon.[66]\\nBeavers also function as ecosystem engineers; in the process of tree-cutting and damming, beavers alter the local ecosystems\\nextensively. Beaver ponds  can provide critical habitat for juvenile salmon.\\nAn example of this was seen in the years following 1818 in the Columbia River Basin. In 1818, the British gove rnment made\\nan agreement with the U.S. gove rnment to allow U.S. citizens access to the Columbia catchment (see Treaty of 1818 ). At the\\ntime, the Hudson's Bay Company sent word to trappers to extirpate all furbearers from the area in an effort to make the area\\nless attractive to U.S. fur traders. In respons e to the elimination of beavers from large parts of the river system, salmon runs\\nplummeted, even in the absence of many of the factors usually associated with the demise of salmon runs. Salmon\\nrecruitment can be affected by be avers' dams because dams can:[67][68][69]\\nSlow the rate at which nutrients are flushed from the water system; nutrients provided by adult salmon dying\\nthroughout the fall and winter remain available in the spring to newly hatched juveniles\\nProvide deeper salmon pools where young salmon can avoid avian predators\\nIncrease productivity through algal photosynthesis and by enhancing the conversion efficiency of the\\ncellulose-powered detritus cycle\\nCreate slow-water environments where juvenile salmon put the food they ingest into growth rather than into\\nfighting currents\\nIncrease structural complexity with many physical niches where salmon can avoid predators\\nBeaver dams are able to nurture salmon juveniles in estuarine tidal marshes where the salinity is less than 10 ppm. Beavers\\nbuild small dams of generally less than 60 cm (2 ft) high in channels in the myrtle zone. These dams can be overtoppe d at high tide and hold water at low\\ntide. This provides refuges for juvenile salmon so they do not  have to swim into large channels where they are subject to predation by l arger fish.[70]\\nIt has been discovered that rivers which have seen a decline or disappearance of anadromous lampreys, loss of the lampreys also affects the salmon in a\\nnegative way. Like salmon, anadromous lampreys stop feeding and die after spawning, and their decomposing bodies release nutrients into the stream. Also,\\nalong with species like rainbow  trout and Sacramento sucker, lampreys clean the gravel in the rivers during spawning.[71] Their larvae, called ammocoetes,\\nare filter feeders which contribute to the health of the waters. They are also a food source for the young salmon, and being fattier and oilier, it is assumed\\npredators prefer them over salmon offspring, taking off some of the predation pressure on smolts.[72] Adult lampreys are also the preferred prey of seals and\\nsea lions, which can eat 30 lampreys to every salmon, allowing more adult salmon to enter the rivers to spawn without being eaten by the marine\\nmammals.[73][74]\\nAccording to Canadian biologist Dorothy Kieser, the myxoz oan parasite Henneguya salminicola is commonly found in the flesh of salmonids. It has been\\nrecorded in the field samples of salmon returning to the Haida Gwaii Islands.

The fish releases the spores after spawning. In the Henneguya case, the spores enter a second host, most likely\\nan invertebrate, in the spawning stream. When juvenile salmon migrate to the Pacific Ocean, the second host releases\\na stage infective to salmon. The parasite is then carried in the salmon until the next spawning cycle. The\\nmyxos porean parasite that causes whirling disease in trout has a similar life cycle.[75] However, as oppos ed to\\nwhirling disease, the Henneguya infestation does not appear to cause disease in the host salmon—e ven heavily\\ninfected fish tend to return to spawn successfully.\\nAccording to Dr. Kieser, a lot of work on Henneguya salminicola was done  by scientists at the Pacific Biological\\nStation in Nanaimo in the mid-1980s , in particular, an overview report[76] which states, \"the fish that have the longe st\\nfresh water residence time as juveniles have the most noticeable infections.

On the Pacific coast of Canada, the\\nlouse-induc ed mortality of pink salmon in some regions is commonly ove r 80% .[85]\\nThe risk of injury caused by unde rwater pile driving has been studied by Dr. Halvorsen and her co-workers.[86] The study concluded that the fish are at risk\\nof injury if the cumulative sound e xposure level exceeds 210 dB relative to 1 μ Pa2 s.\\nAs can be seen from the produc tion chart at the\\nleft, the global capture reported by different\\ncountries to the FAO of commercial wild salmon\\nhas remained fairly steady since 1990 at about\\none million tonne s per year. This is in contrast to\\nfarmed salmon (below) which has increased in\\nthe same period from about 0.6 million tonne s to\\nwell over two million tonne s.[44]\\nNearly all captured wild salmon are Pacific\\nsalmon.

In 2011 only 2,500 tonne s were reported.[12] In contrast,\\nabout half of all farmed salmon are Atlantic salmon.\\nRecreational salmon fishing can be a technically demanding kind of sport fishing, not necessarily intuitive for\\nbeginning fishermen.[87] A conflict exists between commercial fishermen and recreational fishermen for the right to\\nsalmon stock resources. Commercial fishing in estuaries and coastal areas is often restricted so enough salmon can\\nreturn to their natal rivers where they can spawn and be available for sport fishing. On parts of the North American\\nWest Coast salmon sport fishing has completely replaced inshore commercial salmon fishing.[88] In most cases, the\\ncommercial value of a salmon sold as seafood can be several times less than the value attributed to the same fish\\ncaught by a sport fisherman.

Atlantic salmon are also, in very small\\nvolumes, farmed in Russia and Tasmania,\\nAustralia.\\nSalmon are carnivorous, and need to be fed meals produc ed from catching other wild\\nforage fish and other marine organisms. Salmon farming leads to a high demand for wild\\nforage fish. As a predator, salmon require large nutritional intakes of protein, and farmed\\nsalmon consume more fish than they generate as a final produc t. On a dry weight basis, 2–4 kg of wild-caught fish are needed to produc e one kilogram of\\nsalmon.[89] As the salmon farming indus try expands, it requires more forage fish for feed, at a time when 75% of the world\\'s monitored fisheries are already\\nnear to or have exceeded their maximum sustainable yield.[90] The indus trial-scale extraction of wild forage fish for salmon farming affects the survivability\\nof other wild predatory fish which rely on t hem for food. R esearch is ongoi ng into sustainable and pl ant-based salmon feeds.[91]\\nIntensive salmon farming uses open-net cages, which have low produc tion costs. It has the drawback of allowing disease and sea lice to spread to local wild\\nsalmon stocks.[92]\\nAnother form of salmon produc tion, which is safer but less controllable, is to raise salmon in hatcheries until they are\\nold enough to become independent. They are released into rivers in an attempt to increase the salmon popul ation.\\nThis system is referred to as ranching. It was very common in countries such as Sweden, before the Norwegians\\ndeveloped salmon farming, but is seldom done  by private companies. As anyone  may catch the salmon when they\\nreturn to spawn, a company is limited in benefiting financially from their investment.\\nBecause of this, the ranching method has mainly been used by various public authorities and non-profit groups , such\\nas the Cook Inlet Aquaculture Association, as a way to increase salmon popul ations in situations where they have\\ndeclined due to overharvesting, construction of dams and habitat destruction or fragmentation. Negative\\nconsequences to this sort of popul ation manipulation include genetic \"dilution\" of the wild stocks. Many jurisdictions\\nare now beginning to discourage supplemental fish planting in favour of harvest controls, and habitat improvement\\nand pr otection.\\nA variant method of fish stocking, called ocean ranching, is unde r development in Alaska. There, the young salmon are released into the ocean far from any\\nwild salmon streams. When it is time for them to spawn, they return to where they were released, where fishermen can catch them.\\nAn alternative method to hatcheries is to use spawning channels. These are artificial streams, usually parallel to an existing stream, with concrete or rip-rap\\nsides and gravel bottoms. Water from the adjacent stream is piped into the top of the channel, sometimes via a header pond, to settle out sediment. Spawning\\nsuccess is often much better in channels than in adjacent streams due to the control of floods, which in some years can wash out the natural redds. Because of\\nthe lack of floods, spawning channels must sometimes be cleaned out to remove accumulated sediment. The same floods  that destroy natural redds also clean\\nthe regular streams. Spawning channels preserve the natural selection of natural streams, as there is no benefit, as in hatcheries, to use prophyl actic chemicals\\nto control diseases.\\nFarm-raised salmon are fed the carotenoids astaxanthin and canthaxanthin to match their flesh colour to wild salmon[93] to improve their marketability.[94]\\nWild salmon ge t these carotenoids, primarily astaxanthin, from eating shellfish and krill.\\nOne proposed alternative to the use of wild-caught fish as feed for the salmon, is the use of soy-based products. This should be better for the local\\nenvironment of the fish farm, but produc ing soy beans has a high environmental cost for the produc ing region. The fish omega-3 fatty acid content would be\\nreduced compared to fish-fed salmon.\\nAnother possible alternative is a yeast-based coproduc t of bioethanol produc tion, proteinaceous fermentation biomass. Substituting such produc ts for\\nengineered feed can result in equal (sometimes enhanced) growth in fish.[95] With its increasing availability, this would address the problems of rising costs\\nfor buyi ng ha tchery fish feed.\\nYet another attractive alternative is the increased use of seaweed. Seaweed provides essential minerals and vitamins for growing organisms. It offers the\\nadvantage of providing natural amounts of dietary fiber and having a lower glycemic load than grain-based fish meal.[95] In the best-case scenario,\\nwidespread use of seaweed could yield a future in aquaculture that eliminates the need for land, freshwater, or fertilizer to raise fish.[96]\\nSalmon popul ation levels are of concern in the Atlantic and in some parts of the Pacific.[98] The popul ation of wild salmon declined markedly in recent\\ndecades, especially North Atlantic popul ations, which spawn in the waters of western Europe and eastern Canada, and wild salmon in the Snake and\\nColumbia River systems in nor thwestern United States.\\nAlaska fishery stocks are still abunda nt, and catches have been on the rise in recent decades, after the state initiated limitations in 1972.[99][100] Some of the\\nmost important Alaskan salmon sustainable wild fisheries are located near the Kenai River, Coppe r River, and in Bristol Bay.

These declines have been occurring for 30 years, and are thought  to be associated with climate\\nchange and competition w ith growing num bers of pink and ha tchery salmon.[107][97]\\nSalmon is a popul ar food fish. Classified as an oily fish,[108] salmon is considered to be healthy due to the fish\\'s high\\nprotein, high omega-3 fatty acids, and high vitamin D[109] content. Salmon is also a source of cholesterol, with a\\nrange of 23–214 mg/100 g depending on the species.[110] According to reports in the journal Science, farmed salmon\\nmay contain high levels of dioxins. PCB (polychlorinated biphenyl) levels may be up to eight times higher in farmed\\nsalmon than in wild salmon,[111] but still well below levels considered dangerous.[112][113] Nonetheless, according\\nto a 2006 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the benefits of eating even farmed\\nsalmon still outweigh any risks imposed by contaminants.[114] Farmed salmon has a high omega-3 fatty acid content\\ncomparable to wild salmon.[115] The type of omega-3 present may not be a factor for other important health\\nfunctions.\\nSalmon flesh is generally orange to red, although white-fleshed wild salmon with white-black skin colour occurs.\\nThe natural colour of salmon results from carotenoid pigments, largely astaxanthin, but also canthaxanthin, in the\\nflesh.[116] Wild salmon ge t these carotenoids from eating krill and ot her tiny shellfish.\\nThe vast majority of Atlantic salmon available in market around the world are farmed (almost 99%),[117] whereas the\\nmajority of Pacific salmon are wild-caught (greater than 80%). Canned salmon in the U.S. is usually wild Pacific\\ncatch, though some farmed salmon is available in canned form. Smoked salmon is another popul ar preparation\\nmethod, and can either be hot or cold smoked. Lox can refer to either cold-smoked salmon or salmon cured in a brine\\nsolution (also called gravlax). Traditional canned salmon includes some skin (which is harmless) and bone  (which\\nadds calcium). Skinless and bone less canned salmon is also available.\\nRaw salmon flesh may contain Anisakis nematodes, marine parasites that cause anisakiasis. Before the availability of\\nrefrigeration, the Japanese did not consume raw salmon. Salmon and salmon roe have only recently come into use in\\nmaking sashimi (raw fish) and sushi.[118]\\nTo the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast, salmon is considered a vital part of the diet. Specifically, the indigenous  peoples of Haida Gwaii,\\nlocated near former Queen Charlotte Island in British Columbia, rely on salmon as one of their main sources of food, although many other bands have fished\\nPacific waters for centuries.[119] Salmon are not only ancient and unique, but it is important because it is expressed in culture, art forms, and ceremonial\\nfeasts. Annua lly, salmon spawn in Haida, feeding on everything on the way upstream and down.[119] Within the Haida nation, salmon is referred to as\\n\"tsiin\",[119] and is prepared in several ways including smoking, ba king, frying, a nd m aking soup.\\nHistorically, there has always been enough salmon, as traditional subsistence fishing methods did not result in overfishing, and people only took what they\\nneeded.[120] In 2003, a report on First Nations participation in commercial fisheries, including salmon, commissioned by BC\\'s Ministry of Agriculture and\\nFood found that there were 595 First Nation-owned and operated commercial vessels in the province. Of those vessels, First Nations\\' members owned\\n564.[120] However, employment within the indus try has decreased overall by 50% in the last decade, with 8,142 registered commercial fishermen in 2003.\\nThis has affected employment for many fisherman, who rely on s almon as a source of income.\\nBlack bears also rely on s almon as food. T he leftovers the bears leave behind are considered important nutrients for the Canadian forest, such as the soil, trees\\nand plants. In this sense, the salmon feed the forest and in return receive clean water and gravel in which to hatch and grow, sheltered from extremes of\\ntemperature and water flow in times of high and low rainfall.[119] However, the condition of the salmon in Haida has been affected in recent decades. Due to\\nlogging and development, much of the salmon\\'s habitat (i.e., Ain River) has been destroyed, resulting in the fish being close to endangered.[119] ForAs food'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Salmon domain/Salmon.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='Seine fishing for salmon – Wenzel\\nHollar, 1607–1677residents, this has resulted in limits on catches, in turn, has affected families diets, and cultural events such as feasts. Some of the salmon systems in danger\\ninclude: the Davidon, Naden, Mamim, and Mathers.[119] It is clear that further protection is needed for salmon, such as their habitats, where logging\\ncommonly occurs.\\nThe salmon has long been at the heart of the culture and livelihood of coastal dwellers, which can be traced as far\\nback as 5,000 years when archeologists discovered Nisqually tribe remnants.[121] The original distribution of the\\ngenus Oncorhynchus covered the Pacific Rim coastline.[122] History shows salmon used tributaries, rivers and\\nestuaries without regard to jurisdiction for 18–22 million years. Baseline data is near impossible to recreate based on\\nthe inconsistent historical data, but there has been massive depletion since the 1900s . The Pacific Northwest once\\nsprawled with native inhabitants who ensured little degradation was caused by their actions to salmon habitats. As\\nanimists, the indigenous people relied not only for salmon for food, but spiritual guidance. The role of the salmon\\nspirit guided the people to respect ecological systems such as the rivers and tributaries the salmon used for spawning.\\nNatives often used the entire fish and left little waste by turning the bladder into glue, and using bone s for toys and\\nskin for clothing and shoes. The original salmon ceremony, introduc ed by indigenous  tribes on the Pacific coast,\\nconsisted of three major parts. First was the welcoming of the first catch, and then the cooking of it. Finally the bone s\\nwere returned to the sea to induc e hospitality so other salmon w ould give their lives to the people of that village.[123]\\nMany tribes, such as the Yurok, had a taboo against harvesting the first fish that swam upriver in summer, but once they confirmed that the salmon run had\\nreturned in abunda nce they would begin to catch them in plentiful.[124] The indigenous practices were guided by deep ecological wisdom, which was\\neradicated when Euro-American settlements began to be developed.[125] Salmon have a much grander history than what is presently shown today. The\\nsalmon that once dominated the Pacific Ocean are now just a fraction in popul ation and size. The Pacific salmon popul ation is now less than 1–3%  of what it\\nwas when Lewis and Clark arrived at the region.[126] In his 1908 State of the Union address, U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt observed that the fisheries\\nwere in significant decline:[127][128]\\nThe salmon fisheries of the Columbia River are now but a fraction of what they were twenty-five years ago, and what they would be now if the\\nUnited States Government had taken complete charge of them by intervening between Oregon and Washington. During these twenty-five years\\nthe fishermen of each State have naturally tried to take all they could get, and the two legislatures have never been able to agree on joint action\\nof any kind adequate in degree for the protection of the fisheries. At the moment the fishing on the Oregon side is practically closed, while there\\nis no limit on the Washington side of any kind, and no one can tell what the courts will decide as to the very statutes unde r which this action and\\nnon-action result. Meanwhile very few salmon reach the spawning grounds , and probabl y four years hence the fisheries will amount to nothing;\\nand t his comes from a struggle between the associated, or  gill-net, fishermen on t he one hand, and t he owners of the fishing w heels up the river.\\nOn the Columbia River, the Chief Joseph D am completed in 1955 c ompletely blocks salmon m igration to the uppe r Columbia River system.\\nThe Fraser River salmon population was affected by the 1914 slide caused by the Canadian Pacific Railway at Hells Gate. The 1917  catch was one quarter\\nof the 1913 c atch.[129]\\nThe origin of the word for \"salmon\" was one of the arguments about the location of  the origin of the Indo-European langua ges.\\nThe salmon is an important creature in several strands of Celtic mythology and poetry, which often associated them with wisdom and venerability. In Irish\\nfolklore, fishermen associated salmon with fairies and thought  it was unlucky to refer to them by name.[130] In Irish mythology, a creature called the Salmon\\nof Knowledge[131] plays key role in the tale The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn. In the tale, the Salmon will grant powers of know ledge to whoever eats it, and is\\nsought  by poet Finn Eces for seven years. Finally Finn Eces catches the fish and gives it to his young pupil, Fionn mac Cumhaill, to prepare it for him.\\nHowever, Fionn burns his thumb on the salmon\\'s juices, and he instinctively puts it in his mouth. In so doing, he inadvertently gains the Salmon\\'s wisdom.\\nElsewhere in Irish mythology, the salmon is also one  of the incarnations of both Tuan mac Cairill[132] and Fintan mac Bóchra.[133]\\nSalmon also feature in Welsh mythology. In the prose tale Culhwch and Olwen, the Salmon of Llyn Llyw is the oldest animal in Britain, and the only\\ncreature who know s the location of Mabon ap Modron. After speaking to a string of other ancient animals who do not know  his whereabouts, King Arthur\\'s\\nmen Cai and Bedwyr are led to the Salmon of  Llyn Llyw, who lets them ride its back to the walls of Mabon\\'s prison in Gloucester.[134]\\nIn Norse mythology, after Loki tricked the blind god Höðr into killing his brother Baldr, Loki jumped into a river and transformed himself into a salmon to\\nescape punishment from the other gods .

It is a competitor of trout \\nand sockeye in the red fish market. Although Russia has increased its import of this fish \\nover the last few years, Japan remains the largest market.  \\nPink:  Caught in USA and Russia and used for canning, pet food and roe production. \\nSince quality is lower than the other species it is a less valued salmonid. The fish is small in \\nsize (1.5 -1.7 kg) and is caught over a very short time period.  \\nSockeye:  Caught in Russia and Alaska. It is mostly exported frozen to Japan, but some is \\nconsumed locally in Russia and some canned in Alaska. Sockeye is seen as a high quality \\nsalmonid and is used for salted products, sashimi and some is smoked in the EU.  \\nChum: Caught in Japan and Alaska. Most is consumed in Japan and China. In Japan, it \\nis available as fresh, while in China it is processed for local consumption and re -exported. \\nLittle chum is found in the EU market.

Protein resource efficiency is expressed as “Protein retention”, which is \\na measure of how much animal food protein is produced per unit feed protein fed \\nto the animal. Salmon has a protein  retention of 28%, which is more  efficient than  \\npork  and cattle (see table above).  \\n \\nCalorie  retention is measured by dividing calorie s in edible portion  by calories in \\nfeed . Salmon has  a high calorie  retention of 2 5%. \\n \\nThe main reason why salmon convert protein and energy to body muscle and \\nweight so efficiently is that they are cold -blooded and therefore do not have to use \\nenergy to heat their bodies. Furthermore t hey do not expend energy on standing up \\nlike land animals  do.  \\n \\n• Edible yield is calculated by dividing edible meat by total body weight. \\nAtlantic salmon has a high e dible yield of 73%.  \\n \\n• Feed conversion ratios measure how efficiently the different animal protein s \\nare produced . In short, this tells us the kilograms of feed needed to increase \\nthe animal’s bodyweight by one kg. Feed for Atlantic salmon is high in protein \\nand energy which accounts for Atlantic salmon’s feed conversion ratio being \\neven more favourable than its protein and energy retention when compared \\nwith the production of other land animal proteins.   \\n \\n• Edible meat per 100  kg of feed fed  is the combination of the FCR ratio and \\nedible yield  and presents  salmon as giving a favourably high quantity of \\nedible meat per kg of feed fed.   \\n \\nSource: Fry et al (2018) Corrigendum: Feed  conversion efficiency in aquaculture: dow we \\nmeasure it correctly?

The use of these t wo marine raw materials in feed \\nproduction has been reduced in favour of  ingredients such as soy, sunflower, \\nwheat, corn, beans, peas, poultry by -products (in Chile and Canada) and \\nrapeseed oil. This substitution is mainly due to heavy constraints on the \\navailability of fish meal and fish oil.  \\n \\nAtlantic salmon have specific nutrient requirements for amino acids, fatty \\nacids, vitamins, minerals and other lipid - and wate r-soluble components. \\nThese essential nutrients can in principle be provided by the range of different \\nraw materials listed above. Fish meal and other raw materials of animal origin \\nhave a more complete amino acid profile and generally have a higher \\nprotein concentration compared to proteins of vegetable origin. As long as a \\nfish receives the amino acid it needs it will grow and be h ealthy and the \\ncomposition of its muscle protein is the same irrespective of feed protein \\nsource. Consequently, feeding salmon with non -marine protein sources results \\nin a net production of marine fish protein.   \\n \\nDuring the industry’s early phases, salmon feed was moist (high water \\ncontent) with high levels of marine protein (60%) and low levels of fat/oil \\n(10%). In the 1990s, feed typically consisted of 45% protein, made up mostly of \\nmarine protein. Today, the mar ine protein level is lower due to cost \\noptimisation and the availability of fish meal.

The \\nAquaculture Act (17 June 2005) and the Food Safety Act (19 December 2003) are the two \\nmost important laws, and there are detailed provisions set out in the various regulatio ns which \\nemanated from them.  \\n \\nIn Norway, a salmon -farming licen se allows salmon farming either in freshwater \\n(smolt/fingerling production) or in the sea. The number of licen ses for Atlantic salmon and \\ntrout in seawater was limited to 1, 164 in 202 3. Such limitations do not apply for freshwater \\nlicen ses (smolt production), which can be applied for at any time. Seawater licen ses can use \\nup to four farming sites (six sites are allowed when all sites are connected with the same \\nlicen ses). This increases the capacity and efficiency of the sit es. \\n \\nProduction limitations in Norway are regulated as \"maximum allowed biomass\" (MAB), which \\nis the defined maximum volume of fish a company can hold at sea at all times. In general, \\none license sets a MAB of 780 tonnes (945 tonnes in the counties of Troms and  Finnmark). The \\nsum of the MAB permitted by all the licenses held in each region is the farming company\\'s \\ntotal allowed biomass in this region. In addition, each production site has its own MAB and \\nthe total amount of fish at each site must be less than th is set limit. Generally, sites have a \\nMAB of between 2,340 and 4,680 tonnes.  \\n \\nNew seawater licen ses are awarded by the Norwegian Ministry of Trade, Industry and \\nFisheries and are administered by the Directorate of Fisheries. Licen ses can be sold and \\npledged, and legal security is registered in the Aquaculture Register. Since 1982, new licen ses \\nhave been awarded only in certain years and growth in biomass is today regulated on the \\nbasis of the new system for growth implemented in 2017.   \\n \\nThe Norwegian coast is divided into 13 geographical areas of production. The level of sea \\nlice in these areas decide if the MAB can increase ( green area + 6%), stay the same  (yellow \\narea)  or decrease ( red area -6%) in these areas.  Every second year the government \\nannounces the conditions for growth on existing and new licenses. Growth through the \\n“Traffic Light System” has been sold by the government to the industry based on an auction \\nprocess since 2018. The pu rpose of the auction has been to maximise the  proceeds through a \\ncompetitive closed clock auction by tonnes in all green areas. The average price paid for a \\nnew standard license in the auction was NOK 153 million and NOK 171 million in 2018 and \\n2020, respectively. Total proceeds for the government an d local communities were \\napproximately NOK 3.9 billion and NOK 6.9 billion in said years. The Traffic Light System has \\neffectively ensured a form of capturing the resource rent , in exchange  for growth. In 2022 the \\naverage price for a new license was signif icantly reduced to NOK 120 million due to the \\nuncertainty in relation to the proposed resource rent tax scheme . In 2023, the auction for the \\nunsold capacity was carried out at an average price of NOK 143 million.  \\n \\nSites complying with very strict environmental standards are offered additional growth. The \\nconditions for this growth are A)  below 0.1 lice per fish at every counting for the past two \\nyears in the period April 1st to September 30th  and B) a maximum of one  treatment during \\nthe last cycle of production. For sites meeting this standard a maximum of 6% growth is \\noffered, regardless of the general situation in the different production areas. In “red” areas, \\ncompanies will need to reduce production by 6%.  \\n \\nIn October 2021, the Government appointed a committee to review the licensing system in \\nthe Norwegian aquaculture industry. In September 2023, t he committee a ssess ed the \\nobjectives for the license regulations, the entirety of the system and how it can be adapted \\nto existing and new challenges.

Such a scheme was suggested by the Nøstbakken Committee on aquaculture \\nregulations in Norway in September 2023. The purpo se is to create incentives for investing in \\nenvironmental technology, with increased production capacity where such technology is \\nimplemented. According to the request, the scheme should also enable rest oration of \\npreviously reduced volumes in red areas.  \\n \\nResource rent tax on aquaculture was introduced in September 2022 with effect from 1 \\nJanuary 2023 and approved by Parliament on 31 May 2023. The resource rent  tax rate of 25 \\npercent applies to the production of salmon, trout, and rainbow trout in the sea phase, and \\nimplies a marginal tax rate of 47 percent. Activities outside the seawater phase are subject to \\nordinary corporate tax only. Revenues will be based on the market value when the fish are \\nharvested, which the companies themselves will set/determine  for 2023 and 1st half of 2024. \\nFrom July 1st 2024, the Government will use an independent price board.   \\n \\nA tax -free allowance of MNOK 70 is granted at the corporate group level, making the \\nsmallest companies exempt from the resource rent taxation.

The first authorisation is required to operate \\nan aquaculture facility and specifies certain technical requirements. It is issued by the \\nUndersecretaries of Fisheries and Aquaculture (under the Ministry of  Economy). The second \\nauthorisation relates to the physical area which may be operated (or permission to use \\nnational sea areas for aquaculture production). This is issued by the Undersecretaries for \\nArmed Forces (Ministry of Defence). The use of the licen se is restricted to a specific \\ngeographic area, to defined species, and to a specified limit of production. The production \\nlimits are specified in Environmental and Sanitary Resolutions for the issued license. Under \\ncertain conditions, owners can choose to reduce their whole stocking, producing at \\nmaximum density (17kg/m3 for Atlantic salmon ), or to maintain or increase their stocking, \\nusing a limited density (from 4 to 17 kg/m3 for Atlantic salmon) determined by productive, \\nsanitary and environmental conditions of each neighbourhood, any increase over previous \\nstocking numbers means going to  4 kg/m3. Owners can choose only one alternative to stock \\neach semester. From January 2021, all producers have the option to increase the smolt \\nstocking based on a combined score of fish health parameters, related to losses, sea lice \\ntreatments and antibio tic use. The individual company’s performance on the parameters in \\nthe previous period will determine the size of the potential increase in the next smolt stocking. \\nA positive assessment will result in an increase of 9%, 6% or 3%, while a negative assessme nt \\nwill result in a decrease of -3%, -6% or -9%. For example, if antibiotic consumption is below 300 \\ng / tonne, mortality is less than 10% and the indicator related to bath treatments against \\nCaligus is below 50%, the model will allow farmer the option to grow by 6% in the next \\nstocking.  \\n \\nAccess to Licen ses \\nThe trading of licen ses in Chile is regulated by the General Law of Fisheries and Aquaculture \\n(LGPA) and controlled by the Undersecretaries of Fisheries and Aquaculture of the Ministry of \\nEconomy. Aquaculture activities are subject to different governmental authorisations \\ndepe nding on whether they are developed in private fresh water inland facilities (i.e. \\nhatcheries) or in facilities built on public assets such as lakes or rivers (freshwater licen ses) or at \\nsea (seawater licen ses). \\n \\nTo operate a private freshwater aquaculture facility requires ownership of the water -use rights \\nand holding of environmental permits. Environmental permits are issued when operators \\ndemonstrate that their facilities comply with the applicable environmental  regulations.  \\n \\nLicen ses for aquaculture activities in public assets are granted based on an application, \\nwhich must contain a description of the proposed operations, including a plan for complying \\nwith environmental and other applicable regulations. Licen ses granted after April 2010 are \\ngranted for 25  years and are renewable for additional 25 -year terms. Licen ses granted before \\nApril 2010 were granted for indefinite periods. Licen se holders must begin operation within \\none year of receiving a license  and once the operatio n has started, the license  holder \\ncannot stop or suspend production for a period exceeding two consecutive years. Subject to \\ncertain exceptions, licen se holders must maintain minimum operational levels of not less than \\n5% of the yearly production specified in the RCA (Environmental Qualification Resolution). \\nUntil August 2016, all licen ses not used could be kept by the holder if they prepared an official \\nSanitary Management Plan.  \\n \\nLicen se holders must pay annual licen se fees to the Chilean government and may sell or rent \\ntheir licen ses.

The principal Federal laws are the Fisheries Act, the \\nCanadian Navigable Waters Act, The Health of Animal Acts, and the Species at Risk Act. The \\nAquaculture Activities Regulations (AAR) are national regulations that apply throughout \\nCanada. Each province has specific Acts and Regulations that also apply. The three primary \\nfish farming areas in Canada are British Columbia, Newfoundland an d Labrador, and New \\nBrunswick.  \\n \\nTo operate a marine fish farm site, provincial and/or federal authorisations are required. In \\nNewfoundland and Labrador and New Brunswick, the Provincial government is the primary \\nregulator and leasing authority. The Province regulates the activity and operations of \\naquaculture and issues the Aquaculture License , Crown Land lease and Water Use License \\nwhere fish farms are located. In Newfoundland  and Labrador , the Crown Land Lease for the \\nsite is issued for 50 years , the Aquaculture License is issued for 6 years , and the Water Use \\nLicense is issued for 5 years . In New Brunswick, individual sites are typically granted lease for 20 \\nyears.  All Commercial Aquaculture Licenses are renewable but may be lost or suspended for \\nnon-compliance issues and non -payment of fees.  Farms in New Brunswick are also issued an \\nApproval to Operate with a 5 year term limit by the provincial department of Environment \\nDepartment.  \\n \\nIn British Columbia, Federal and Provincial authori sations are required to operate a marine fish \\nfarm site. The Federal Government regulates the activity and operations of aquaculture while \\nthe Provincial Government administers the Crown lands where fish farms are located. The \\nProvince grants a license to o ccupy an area of the ocean associated with the individual fish \\nfarming site. The tenured encompasses the rearing pens, ancillary infrastructure and all \\nmoorings. Individual site tenures have a specific timeline ranging from five to twenty years. \\nThe term o f tenure is based upon the provincial policy at the time of offer. In 202 4, the annual \\nfee for a typical 35 hectares tenure is $2 2,000 CAD per year. This fee is calculated based on \\nthe tenure size and a provincially indexed land value. Each tenure license contains a renewal \\nprovision once expired.  After the tenure term has expired, it becomes a month to month \\noccupancy until it is either renewed or returned to the Crown. It is uncommon for a tenure to \\nnot be renewed, however breaches to a tenure agreement c an result in  non-renewal .  \\n \\nThe production limitations in Canada are regulated as either a “Maximum Allowable \\nBiomass” or a fixed number of smolt per cycle.  “MAB” is specific to each Aquaculture \\nlicen sed facility in British Columbia. Smaller farms are typically licen sed for 2,200mt. with larger \\ncapacity facilities licen sed to produce 5,000 mt. per cycle. In Newfoundland and Labrador \\nand New Brunswick, a maximum number of smolt per cycle is given to a farm. Farms are \\ntypically licen sed for 600,000 to 1,000,000 smolt per cycle in Newfo undland  and Labrador , \\nand 2 50,000 to 600,000 smolt per cycle in New Brunswick.  \\n \\nIn British Columbia, t he Federal Government grants an Aquaculture License with conditions \\nthat a farm must meet. The Aquaculture license conditions are linked to The Fisheries Act. \\nAquaculture license conditions specify the species being farmed, the Maximum Allowable \\nBiomass (M AB) on the site, the type of rearing equipment and the allowable environmental \\nimpact.  Production or “MAB” is specific to each site. The annual licen se fee is calculated at \\n$2.95 CAD per ton of MAB for operational sites.

Production and stocking density limit is \\nspecified in an Environmental and Sanitary Resolution issued for each specific licens e. The \\ndensity limit may depend on production conditions as well as sanitary and environmental \\nconditions.   \\n \\nThe size of the area and density limits etc. for each of the 20 sea licens es vary greatly. \\nProduction limitations in the Faroes are not regulated through limits on ”maximum allowed \\nbiomass”, MAB. As a consequence, MAB for salmon farms varies between 1,200 tonnes and \\n5,800 tonnes a year per licens e, depending on site characteristics and the geographic \\nlocation of the individual farm.  \\n \\nIn 2012 and 2018 the Government of the Faroe Islands announced revised aquaculture \\nregulations with the aim of securing sustainable growth in the industry and in order to \\nimplement anti -trust regulations.  \\n \\nMowi Faroes is first and foremost affected by the anti -trust regulations in the Aquaculture Act. \\nThese rules set a cap of 20% for either direct or indirect foreign ownership in Faroese fish \\nfarming companies. If the limit is exceeded with regard to a fish farming company, the \\ncompany must adjust its ownership to be within the limit within a short deadline set by the \\nauthorities or face possible loss of the right to conduct fish farming activities.  \\n \\nMowi Faroes is 100% owned by Mowi ASA (NO). This ownership is protected by transitional \\nprovisions in the Aquaculture Act, securing that the company can remain owned by a \\nforeign company and nonetheless keep its licens es. The consequence for Mowi Faroes of the \\nAnti-trust regulations is that the company cannot expand its business with additional \\ncommercial licens es to farm fish in the sea. Mowi Faroes can however apply for development \\nlicens es and licens es on land.  \\n \\nIt is stipulated in the Aquaculture Act that a fish farming company cannot hold more than \\n50% of the total sea licens es.

With the introduction of \\nvaccines a considerable number of bacterial and viral health issues have \\nbeen effectively controlled, with the additional benefit that the quantity of \\nlicensed medicine s prescribed in the industry has been reduced.  \\n \\nIn some instances medicinal treatment is still required to avoid mortality and \\nfor the well -being and welfare of the fish. Even the best managed farms may \\nhave to use licensed medicines from time to time , if other measures are not \\nsufficient . For several viral diseases, no effective vaccines are currently \\navailable.  \\n  '),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Salmon domain/Salmon-Industry-Handbook.pdf', 'page': 99}, page_content='Risk Factors  \\n \\n100 | P a g e  \\n  \\n  Most important health risks to salmon  \\n \\nSea lice: There are several species of sea lice, which are naturally occurring \\nseawater parasites. They can infect the salmon skin and if not controlled they \\ncan cause lesions and secondary infection. Sea lice are controlled through \\ngood husbandry and management pra ctices, the use of lice prevention \\nbarriers ( e.g. skirts) , by submerging  the salmon  using  Tubenet , cleaner fish \\n(different wrasse species and lumpsuckers, which eat the lice off the salmon), \\nmechanical removal systems and when necessary licen sed medicines.  \\n \\nCardiomyopathy syndrome (CMS):  CMS is a chronic disease that can \\ndevelop over several months and is caused by the piscine myocarditis virus \\n(PMCV). Mortality typically occurs in large seawater fish . A typical disease \\nevent  can last one to six months. Control is achieved mainly by good  \\nhusbandry and management practices and keep ing the fish in conditions \\nthat satisfy their biological needs for food, clean water, space and habitat.  \\n \\nSalmonid Rickettsial Septicaemia (SRS):  SRS is caused by  intracellular \\nbacteria. It occurs mainly in Chile but has also been observed, albeit to a \\nmuch lesser extent, in Norway, Ireland  and the UK. It causes lethargy  and \\nappetite loss , and can result in elevated mortality. SRS is to some extent \\ncontrolled by vaccination, but medicinal intervention may also be required.  \\n \\nHeart and Skeletal Muscle Inflammation (HSMI): HSMI is currently reported in \\nNorway and to a lesser extent Scotland. Symptoms of HSMI are reduced \\nappetite, abnormal behaviour and in most cases low mortality. HSMI \\ngenerally affects fish in their first year in sea and control is achieved mainly by \\ngood h usbandry and management practices.  \\n \\nInfectious Salmon Anaemia (ISA): ISA is caused by the ISA virus and is widely \\nreported. It is a contagious disease that causes lethargy  and anaemia and \\nmay lead to significant mortality in seawater if not appropriately managed. \\nControl of ISA is achieved through culling or harvesting of affected fish and \\nthe application of stringent  biosecurity and mitigation measures.  Vaccines \\nare available and are in use in areas where ISA is considered to represent a \\nrisk. \\n \\nGill Disease (GD): GD is a general term used to describe gill conditions \\noccurring in sea. The changes may be caused by different infectious agents; \\namoeba, virus or bacteria, as well as environmental factors including algae or \\njellyfish.  Little is known about the cause of many of the gill conditions and to \\nwhat extent infectious or environmental factors are primary or secondary, \\nhow they interact, and causes of disease.

The three primary fish farming areas in Canada are British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador, and New Brunswick. In Newfoundland and Labrador and New Brunswick, the Provincial government is the primary regulator and leasing authority. The Province regulates the activity and operations of aquaculture and issues the Aquaculture License, Crown Land lease, and Water Use License where fish farms are located. In Newfoundland and Labrador, the Crown Land Lease for the site is issued for 50 years, the Aquaculture License is issued for 6 years, and the Water Use License is issued for 5 years. In New Brunswick, individual sites are typically granted a lease for 20 years. In British Columbia, Federal and Provincial authorizations are required to operate a marine fish farm site. The Federal Government regulates the activity and operations of aquaculture while the Provincial Government administers the Crown lands where fish farms are located. The Province grants a license to occupy an area of the ocean associated with the individual fish farming site. The tenured encompasses the rearing pens, ancillary infrastructure, and all moorings. Individual site tenures have a specific timeline ranging from five to twenty years.\",\n          \"Maximising survival and maintaining healthy fish stocks are primarily achieved through good husbandry and health management practices and policies, which reduce exposure to pathogens and the risk of health challenges. The success of good health management practices has been demonstrated on many occasions and has contributed to an overall improvement in the survival of farmed salmonids. Fish health management plans, veterinary health plans, biosecurity plans, risk mitigation plans, contingency plans, disinfection procedures, surveillance schemes, as well as coordinated and synchronised zone/area management approaches, all support healthy stocks with an emphasis on disease prevention. Prevention of many diseases is achieved through vaccination at an early stage and while the salmon are in freshwater. Vaccines are widely used commercially to reduce the risk of health challenges. With the introduction of vaccines a considerable number of bacterial and viral health issues have been effectively controlled, with the additional benefit that the quantity of licensed medicines prescribed in the industry has been reduced. In some instances medicinal treatment is still required to avoid mortality and for the well-being and welfare of the fish. Even the best managed farms may have to use licensed medicines from time to time, if other measures are not sufficient.\",\n          \"A seine net is a type of fishing net that hangs vertically in the water with its bottom edge held down by weights and its top edge buoyed by floats. It is a very long net, sometimes featuring a bag in the center, which is deployed either from the shore or from a boat to surround a designated area. The net is operated using two ropes attached to its ends. Pair seines are designed for pair fishing, where two boats operate the net in pair.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 14,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" There are several regulations for fish farming in Canada based on geographical area. In British Columbia, the federal government regulates the activity and operations of aquaculture, while the provincial government administers the crown lands where fish farms are located. The provincial government grants a license to occupy an area of the ocean associated with the individual fish farming site. The tenured encompasses the rearing pens, ancillary infrastructure, and all moorings. The term of tenure is based upon the provincial policy at the time of offer. In 2024, the annual fee for a typical 35 hectares tenure is $2,200 CAD per year. This fee is calculated based on the tenure size and a provincially indexed land value. Each tenure license contains a renewal provision once expired. After the tenure term has expired, it becomes a month to month occupancy until it is either renewed or returned to the Crown. It is uncommon for a tenure to not be renewed, however breaches to a tenure agreement can result in non-renewal. The production limitations in Canada are regulated as either a \\\"Maximum Allowable Biomass\\\" or a fixed number of smolt per cycle. \\\"MAB\\\" is specific to each Aquaculture license in British Columbia. Smaller farms are typically licensed for 2,200mt. with larger capacity facilities licensed to produce 5,000 mt. per cycle. In Newfoundland and Labrador and New Brunswick, a maximum number of smolt per cycle is given to a farm. Farms are typically licensed for 600,000 to 1,000,000 smolt per cycle in Newfoundland and Labrador, and 250,000 to 600,000 smolt per cycle in New Brunswick. In Newfoundland and Labrador and New Brunswick, the provincial government is the primary regulator and leasing authority.

to visually identify\\nbecause the needle or surgical wounds left after the device is implanted will\\nheal and leave little to no scarring. To address this issue, we often add an\\nexternal tag to fish along with the internal device.\\n\\n## Report a fish tag\\n\\nTo help us with our research, you can report a tagged fish you have caught.\\nWhen you report a fish tag, we will ask you to provide the following\\ninformation:\\n\\n  * when and where you caught the tagged fish\\n  * the fish’s unique tag identification number\\n  * whether you harvested (kept) or released the fish\\n\\nThis important information allows our biologists and researchers to better\\nunderstand our fish populations and develop science-based policy, fishing\\nregulations and conservation initiatives.* * *\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nA fish tag is a marking or device that helps biologists and researchers\\nidentify an individual fish or groups of fish. Fish tags can be located\\neither:\\n\\n  * on the outside of the fish (known as external tags)\\n  * inside the body of the fish (known as internal tags)\\n\\n## Why we tag fish\\n\\nWe tag fish to collect information about fish:\\n\\n  * population size\\n  * mortality rates\\n  * growth\\n  * movement\\n  * habitat use\\n\\nTo learn about the fish population using external tags, we require other\\ninformation from the person who caught the fish, such as:\\n\\n  * the fish species\\n  * when and where you caught the tagged fish\\n  * the fish’s unique tag identification number\\n  * whether you harvested (kept) or released the fish\\n\\nIf we know how many tagged fish are captured and harvested by anglers,\\nbiologists can estimate **population size and**  mortality rate of a fish\\npopulation (how many fish died).\\n\\nMany internal fish tag devices actively transmit a signal. Biologists or\\nresearchers can pick up the signal by tracking fish in the field or by using\\nstationary receivers located in the environment near the fish (Figure 1). The\\ndata from the signals can provide more detailed information on fish movement\\nand habitat use, which is difficult to get from external tags.\\n\\nImage\\n\\n**Figure 1:** Examples of a) a biologist actively tracking fish movement using\\na radio antenna and b) a stationary acoustic receiver on the lake bottom.\\n\\nWe have tagged many fish species in watersheds across Ontario. Learn about our\\nongoing fish tagging studies on Ontario GeoHub:\\n\\n  * Lake Ontario Atlantic salmon\\n\\n## External fish tags\\n\\nExternal tags are often made of metal or plastic. They can be clamped onto the\\nbody or inserted into the fish’s muscle tissue, like a piercing.\\n\\nSome of the most common external tags we use are:\\n\\n  * jaw tags\\n  * spaghetti tags\\n  * loop tags\\n  * disc tags\\n\\nAll external fish tags have a unique code that allows us to identify the fish.\\nOther information printed on tags include the name of the agency or\\ninstitution that tagged the fish and their contact information so they can be\\nnotified if a fish is caught.\\n\\nImage\\n\\n**Figure 2:** Examples of fish tags we use a) jaw tag, b) spaghetti tag, c)\\nloop tag, and d) disc tag.\\n\\n## Internal tags\\n\\nImage\\n\\n**Figure 3:** Examples of internal tags used by the MRNF: a) Embedded Passive\\nTransponder, b) radio transmitter, c) acoustic transmitter.\"\\n\\nInternal devices are used to:\\n\\n  * identify a fish\\n  * provide information on fish movement and habitat use\\n\\nInternal devices can be implanted with a needle or surgically implanted in the\\nfish’s abdominal cavity. The main types of internal tags are:\\n\\n  * passive integrated transponders (PIT tags)\\n  * radio transmitters\\n  * acoustic transmitters\\n\\nInternal devices send out a signal that provides a unique code to identify an\\nindividual fish']\n","5

Discussions \\nAutomation of the tuna length measurement process is important because it will make the length \\nmeasurement more accurate and faster compare to manual measurement. Thus, it is important to make \\nthe measurement process automatic to increase the efficiency of the measurement process and increase the effectiveness of tuna catch regulation. \\nThere are other features that need to take into consideration in measuring tuna length using machine \\nvision such as the visual perspective of the object, the angle of the camera to the object, and the distance between the camera and the object. The angle of the camera is very important as it will greatly affect the visual perspective of the object [3]. There are study had been made by taking in the one of the features for fish length measurement method [6,11] but no research had been done yet by using all of \\nthe features for fish length measurement method by  considering all of the measurement environment \\nfactor. Usage of lightbox have higher accuracy in measuring the length of other smaller fish [2] but the \\ndisadvantage of using lightbox is it cannot fit the tuna  body as tuna body is too big to be fit into the \\nlightbox. There were a number of researches had been done with smaller fish species, but they were not \\nyet tested on tuna fish [8]. \\nAlthough the length measurement result has a low error rate, it is still not satisfactory. More research \\nneeded to be done in order to increase the accura cy rate of fish length measurement. Based on [2], \\nalthough the method can be used on both smaller and bigger fish, the result of the length measurement very different from each other.']\n","6

Within Salmo, the Adriatic salmon (Salmo\\nobtusirostris) and Black Sea salmon (Salmo labrax) have both been named as salmon in English, although they fall outside the generally recognized seven salmon species. The\\nmasu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) is actually considered a trout (\"cherry trout\") in Japan, with masu actually being the Japanese word for trout. On the other hand, the\\nsteelhead and sea trout, the anadromous forms of rainbow trout and brown trout respectively, are from the same genera as salmon and live identical migratory lives, but\\nneither is termed \"salmon\" .\\nThe extinct Eosalmo driftwoode nsis, the oldest know n Salmoninae fish in the fossil record, helps scientists figure how the different species of salmon\\ndiverged from a common ancestor. The Eocene salmon\\'s fossil from British Columbia provides evidence that the divergence between Pacific and Atlantic\\nsalmon had not yet occurred 40 million years ago. Both the fossil record and analysis of mitochondr ial DNA suggest the divergence occurred 10 to 20\\nmillion years ago during the Miocene. This independent evidence from DNA analysis and the fossil record indicate that salmon divergence occurred long\\nbefore the Quaternary glaciation began the cycle of glacial advance and retreat.[33]\\nThere are several other species of fish which are colloquially called \"salmon\" but are not true salmon. Of those listed below, the Danube  salmon or huchen is\\na large freshwater salmonid closely related (from the same subfamily) to the seven species of salmon above , but others are fishes of unrelated orders, given\\nthe common na me \"salmon\" simply due  to similar shapes, behaviors and niches occupied:Non-salmon species of \"salmon\"pacific salmon:\\nThere are five species of Pacific salmon, which occur in the North Pacific waters of the United States and Canada -- Chinook, Chum, Coho, Pink, and Sockeye. All five species are anadromous, meaning that they spawn in freshwater, migrate to the ocean to forage and mature, and return to freshwater to spawn and begin the cycle again.\\noncorhynchus tshawytscha:\\nThe class which contains all instances of Oncorhynchus tshawytscha.\\noncorhynchus tshawytscha:\\nOncorhynchus tshawytscha (i.e. Chinook salmon) is the largest of the five species of Pacific salmon.\\n\\nPhysical Description: The Chinook is blue-green, red, or purple on the back and top of the head, with silvery sides and white ventral surfaces. It has black spots on its tail and the upper half of its body. Although spots are seen on the tail in pink salmon, and silver on the tail in coho and chum salmon, Chinook are unique among the Pacific salmon in combining black spots and silver on the tail. Another distinctive feature is a black gum line that is present in both salt and freshwater. Adult fish range in size from 24 to 36 in (61 to 91 cm), but may be up to 58 in (150 cm) in length; they average 10 to 50 lb (4.5 to 22.7 kg), but may reach 130 lb (59 kg). The meat can be either pink or white in color, depending on what the salmon have been feeding on.\\n\\nRange: Chinook are anadromous fish native to the North Pacific Ocean and the river systems of western North America, ranging from California to Alaska, as well as Asian rivers ranging from northern Japan to the Palyavaam River in the Arctic northeast Siberia. They have been introduced to other parts of the world, including New Zealand, thriving in Lake Michigan Great Lakes of North America and Michigan\\'s western rivers, and Patagonia.\\noncorhynchus spp.:\\nOncorhynchus is a genus of fish in the family Salmonidae; it contains the Pacific salmon and Pacific trout. The name of the genus is derived from the Greek ὄγκος (ónkos, “lump, bend”) + ῥύγχος (rhúnkhos, “snout”), in reference to the hooked jaws of males in the mating season (the \"kype\").\\nsalmonid type:\\nIn biological taxonomy, Type generically refers to the official name applied to a taxon. This Class constrains Type members as belonging to family Salmonidae\\noncorhynchus keta:\\nThe class which contains all instances of Oncorhynchus keta.\\noncorhynchus keta:\\nOncorhynchus keta (i.e. chum salmon) is one of the five species of Pacific salmon.\\n\\nPhysical Description: The body of the chum salmon is deeper than most salmonid species. In common with other species found in the Pacific, the anal fin has 12 to 20 rays, compared with a maximum of 12 in European species. Chum have an ocean coloration of silvery blue green with some indistinct spotting in a darker shade, and a rather paler belly. When they move into fresh water the color changes to dark olive green and the belly color deepens. When adults are near spawning, they have purple blotchy streaks near the caudal peduncle, darker towards the tail. Spawning males typically grow an elongated snout or kype, their lower fins become tipped with white and they have enlarged teeth. Some researchers speculate these characteristics are used to compete for mates.\\n\\nRange: Chum salmon have the largest natural range of any Pacific salmon, and undergo the longest migrations within the genus Oncorhynchus, far up the Yukon River and deep into the Amur River basin in Asia. In lesser numbers they migrate thousands of kilometres up the Mackenzie River. Chum are found around the north Pacific, in the waters of Korea, Japan, and the Okhotsk and Bering seas (Kamchatka, Chukotka, Kuril Islands, Sakhalin, Khabarovsk Krai, Primorsky Krai), British Columbia in Canada, and from Alaska to California in the United States.

Licenses  \\n \\n91 | P a g e  \\n  \\n  Regulation of fish farming in Canada  \\n \\nLicen se and location  \\nFish farming companies in Canada are subject to different regulations depending on the \\ngeographical area they operate in. The principal Federal laws are the Fisheries Act, the \\nCanadian Navigable Waters Act, The Health of Animal Acts, and the Species at Risk Act. The \\nAquaculture Activities Regulations (AAR) are national regulations that apply throughout \\nCanada. Each province has specific Acts and Regulations that also apply. The three primary \\nfish farming areas in Canada are British Columbia, Newfoundland an d Labrador, and New \\nBrunswick.  \\n \\nTo operate a marine fish farm site, provincial and/or federal authorisations are required. In \\nNewfoundland and Labrador and New Brunswick, the Provincial government is the primary \\nregulator and leasing authority. The Province regulates the activity and operations of \\naquaculture and issues the Aquaculture License , Crown Land lease and Water Use License \\nwhere fish farms are located. In Newfoundland  and Labrador , the Crown Land Lease for the \\nsite is issued for 50 years , the Aquaculture License is issued for 6 years , and the Water Use \\nLicense is issued for 5 years . In New Brunswick, individual sites are typically granted lease for 20 \\nyears.  All Commercial Aquaculture Licenses are renewable but may be lost or suspended for \\nnon-compliance issues and non -payment of fees.  Farms in New Brunswick are also issued an \\nApproval to Operate with a 5 year term limit by the provincial department of Environment \\nDepartment.  \\n \\nIn British Columbia, Federal and Provincial authori sations are required to operate a marine fish \\nfarm site. The Federal Government regulates the activity and operations of aquaculture while \\nthe Provincial Government administers the Crown lands where fish farms are located. The \\nProvince grants a license to o ccupy an area of the ocean associated with the individual fish \\nfarming site. The tenured encompasses the rearing pens, ancillary infrastructure and all \\nmoorings. Individual site tenures have a specific timeline ranging from five to twenty years. \\nThe term o f tenure is based upon the provincial policy at the time of offer. In 202 4, the annual \\nfee for a typical 35 hectares tenure is $2 2,000 CAD per year. This fee is calculated based on \\nthe tenure size and a provincially indexed land value. Each tenure license contains a renewal \\nprovision once expired.  After the tenure term has expired, it becomes a month to month \\noccupancy until it is either renewed or returned to the Crown. It is uncommon for a tenure to \\nnot be renewed, however breaches to a tenure agreement c an result in  non-renewal .  \\n \\nThe production limitations in Canada are regulated as either a “Maximum Allowable \\nBiomass” or a fixed number of smolt per cycle.  “MAB” is specific to each Aquaculture \\nlicen sed facility in British Columbia. Smaller farms are typically licen sed for 2,200mt. with larger \\ncapacity facilities licen sed to produce 5,000 mt. per cycle. In Newfoundland and Labrador \\nand New Brunswick, a maximum number of smolt per cycle is given to a farm. Farms are \\ntypically licen sed for 600,000 to 1,000,000 smolt per cycle in Newfo undland  and Labrador , \\nand 2 50,000 to 600,000 smolt per cycle in New Brunswick.  \\n \\nIn British Columbia, t he Federal Government grants an Aquaculture License with conditions \\nthat a farm must meet. The Aquaculture license conditions are linked to The Fisheries Act. \\nAquaculture license conditions specify the species being farmed, the Maximum Allowable \\nBiomass (M AB) on the site, the type of rearing equipment and the allowable environmental \\nimpact.  Production or “MAB” is specific to each site. The annual licen se fee is calculated at \\n$2.95 CAD per ton of MAB for operational sites']\n","10

harvest volumes are standing \\nbiomass, feed consumption  and smolt release. These are good indicators for \\nmedium - and long -term harvest, while the best short -term indicator is standing \\nbiomass categori sed by size. As harvested size is normally above 4 kg, the \\navailable biomass  of this size class is therefore the best estimate of short -term \\nsupply.  \\n \\nIf no actual numbers on smolt releases are available, vaccine sales could be \\na good indicator of number of smolt releases and when the smolt is put to \\nsea. This is a good indicator of long -term harvest volumes as it takes up to 2 \\nyears from smolt release to harvest.  \\n  \\nVariation in seawater temperature can materially impact the length of the \\nproduction cycle. A warmer winter can for example increase harvest volumes \\nfor the relevant year, partly at the expense of the subsequent year.  \\n  \\nDisease outbreaks can also impact harvest volume due to mortality and \\ngrowth  slowdown3% of global seafood supply  14 \\n Considerable opportunities within aquaculture  15 \\n Supply of farmed and wild salmonids  16 \\n Salmonids harvest 2023  17 \\n3

Within Salmo, the Adriatic salmon (Salmo\\nobtusirostris) and Black Sea salmon (Salmo labrax) have both been named as salmon in English, although they fall outside the generally recognized seven salmon species. The\\nmasu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) is actually considered a trout (\"cherry trout\") in Japan, with masu actually being the Japanese word for trout. On the other hand, the\\nsteelhead and sea trout, the anadromous forms of rainbow trout and brown trout respectively, are from the same genera as salmon and live identical migratory lives, but\\nneither is termed \"salmon\" .\\nThe extinct Eosalmo driftwoode nsis, the oldest know n Salmoninae fish in the fossil record, helps scientists figure how the different species of salmon\\ndiverged from a common ancestor.

Both the fossil record and analysis of mitochondr ial DNA suggest the divergence occurred 10 to 20\\nmillion years ago during the Miocene. This independent evidence from DNA analysis and the fossil record indicate that salmon divergence occurred long\\nbefore the Quaternary glaciation began the cycle of glacial advance and retreat.[33]\\nThere are several other species of fish which are colloquially called \"salmon\" but are not true salmon.

All five species are anadromous, meaning that they spawn in freshwater, migrate to the ocean to forage and mature, and return to freshwater to spawn and begin the cycle again.\\noncorhynchus tshawytscha:\\nThe class which contains all instances of Oncorhynchus tshawytscha.\\noncorhynchus tshawytscha:\\nOncorhynchus tshawytscha (i.e. Chinook salmon) is the largest of the five species of Pacific salmon.\\n\\nPhysical Description: The Chinook is blue-green, red, or purple on the back and top of the head, with silvery sides and white ventral surfaces. It has black spots on its tail and the upper half of its body. Although spots are seen on the tail in pink salmon, and silver on the tail in coho and chum salmon, Chinook are unique among the Pacific salmon in combining black spots and silver on the tail. Another distinctive feature is a black gum line that is present in both salt and freshwater. Adult fish range in size from 24 to 36 in (61 to 91 cm), but may be up to 58 in (150 cm) in length; they average 10 to 50 lb (4.5 to 22.7 kg), but may reach 130 lb (59 kg). The meat can be either pink or white in color, depending on what the salmon have been feeding on.\\n\\nRange: Chinook are anadromous fish native to the North Pacific Ocean and the river systems of western North America, ranging from California to Alaska, as well as Asian rivers ranging from northern Japan to the Palyavaam River in the Arctic northeast Siberia.

The name of the genus is derived from the Greek ὄγκος (ónkos, “lump, bend”) + ῥύγχος (rhúnkhos, “snout”), in reference to the hooked jaws of males in the mating season (the \"kype\").\\nsalmonid type:\\nIn biological taxonomy, Type generically refers to the official name applied to a taxon. This Class constrains Type members as belonging to family Salmonidae\\noncorhynchus keta:\\nThe class which contains all instances of Oncorhynchus keta.\\noncorhynchus keta:\\nOncorhynchus keta (i.e. chum salmon) is one of the five species of Pacific salmon.\\n\\nPhysical Description: The body of the chum salmon is deeper than most salmonid species. In common with other species found in the Pacific, the anal fin has 12 to 20 rays, compared with a maximum of 12 in European species. Chum have an ocean coloration of silvery blue green with some indistinct spotting in a darker shade, and a rather paler belly. When they move into fresh water the color changes to dark olive green and the belly color deepens. When adults are near spawning, they have purple blotchy streaks near the caudal peduncle, darker towards the tail. Spawning males typically grow an elongated snout or kype, their lower fins become tipped with white and they have enlarged teeth. Some researchers speculate these characteristics are used to compete for mates.\\n\\nRange: Chum salmon have the largest natural range of any Pacific salmon, and undergo the longest migrations within the genus Oncorhynchus, far up the Yukon River and deep into the Amur River basin in Asia. In lesser numbers they migrate thousands of kilometres up the Mackenzie River. Chum are found around the north Pacific, in the waters of Korea, Japan, and the Okhotsk and Bering seas (Kamchatka, Chukotka, Kuril Islands, Sakhalin, Khabarovsk Krai, Primorsky Krai), British Columbia in Canada, and from Alaska to California in the United States. In the Arctic Ocean they are found in limited numbers from the Laptev Sea to the Beaufort SeaPacific salmon leaping at Willamette Falls, Oregon\\nCommercial production of salmon in million tonnes\\n1950–2010[44]\\nLife cycle of Pacific salmonSome other fishes called salmon\\nCommon\\nnameScientific name OrderMaximum\\nlengthCommon\\nlengthMaximum\\nweightMaximum\\nageTrophic\\nlevelFish\\nBaseFAOITIS IUCN status\\nAustralian\\nsalmonArripis trutta (Forster,\\n1801)Perciformes89 cm (2 ft\\n11 in)47 cm (1 ft\\n7 in)9.4 kilograms\\n(21 lb)26 years 4.1[34] [35]Not assessed\\nDanube\\nsalmonHucho hucho\\n(Linnaeus, 1758)Salmoniformes150 cm (4 ft\\n11 in)70 cm (2 ft\\n4 in)52 kilograms\\n(115 lb)15 years 4.2[36] [37]\\nEndangered[38]\\nHawaiian\\nsalmonElagatis bipinnulata\\n(Quoy &amp; Gaimard, 1825)Carangiformes180 cm (5 ft\\n11 in)90 cm (2 ft\\n11 in)46.2\\nkilograms\\n(102 lb)6 years 3.6[39] [40] [41]Not assessed\\nIndian\\nsalmonEleutheronema\\ntetradactylum (Shaw,\\n1804)Perciformes200 cm (6 ft\\n7 in)50 cm (1 ft\\n8 in)145\\nkilograms\\n(320 lb)years 4.4[42] [43]Not assessed\\nAtlantic salmon (Salmo salar) reproduce in northern rivers on both coasts of the\\nAtlantic Ocean.\\nLandlocked Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar m. sebago) is a potamodromous\\n(migratory only between fresh waters) subspecies/morph that live in a number of\\nlakes in eastern North America and in Northern Europe, for instance in lakes\\nSebago, Onega, Ladoga, Saimaa, Vänern and Winnipesaukee.

Pair seines are designed for pair fishing, where two boats operate the net in pair.\n","1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Surrounding nets and lift nets prevent fish from escaping using netting panels.\n","2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Trollers in commercial salmon fisheries use hooks and lines suspended from large poles extending from the fishing vessel to catch pelagic fishes.\n","3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   In subistence fishery fishes or other seafood are harvested for noncommercial, customary and traditional uses.

The tag then emits a unique identification code back to the reader.\\n- Acoustic tags: small, electronic, sound-emitting devices which collects information on fish's physiology and/or movement patterns. Data are transmitted wirelessly, usually through the use of radio waves, acoustic signals or via satellite communication. Reading is done using the tag’s associated equipment, often through a computer connection.\\n- Radio tags: emit a radio signal that can be detected by a receiver. Like acoustic tags, radio tags allow researchers to track the movements of tagged fish.\\nThe tags are inserted into the fish’s abdominal cavity through a needle or surgical wound, which heals and leaves little to no scarring.\n","5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The length measurement type used for tuna is fork length. Fork length is the distance from the tip of the snout to the fork of the tail. It is the most commonly used length measurement type for tuna. Automatic methods used for tuna length measurement are Hough transform, image thinning, best fitting rectangle, Hsiu method and grade-3 polynomial regression. Each method has its own strengths and weaknesses. For example, the Hough transform has a low error rate of less than 5%, while the Hsiu method has a high accuracy rate of measuring smaller fish lengths. However, these methods have not been widely used for tuna length measurement due to their limitations and challenges.\n","6     The life stages of salmon are summarized as follows:\\n\\nEgg (Ova): the salmon begins life as a pea-sized egg, hidden under loose gravel in cool, clean rivers. Eggs have a high mortality rate, with only a small percentage surviving to hatch.\\n\\nAlevin: upon hatching in spring, the fish are called alevins and have a yolk sac attached, providing nourishment. Once the yolk sac is absorbed, alevins become active, move through the gravel, and must gulp air to fill their swim bladders for neutral buoyancy.\\n\\nFry: they have eight fins and feed on microscopic invertebrates during summer; they are typically found in shallow waters near the shoreline.\\n\\nParr: in autumn, fry develop into parr; they have vertical stripes and spots for camouflage and they feed on aquatic insects, growing for 1-3 years while establishing territories in the stream.\\n\\nJuvenile: young fish, mostly similar in form to adult but not yet sexually mature.\\n\\nSmolt: once they reach 10-25 cm, parr undergo smolting; they become silvery and start swimming with the current, preparing for ocean migration.\\n\\nJack: precocial male salmon that have spent one winter less in the ocean than the youngest females of a given species.\\n\\nGrilse (Adult Salmon): smolts migrated to the ocean that exhibit strong homing instincts to return to their river of origin to spawn.\\n\\nKelt: after spawning, salmon are referred to as kelts; weakened from not eating and the energy expended in reproduction, many kelts die.\n","7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The Pacific salmon species are:\\n- Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha): Also known as king salmon or blackmouth salmon, and spring salmon in British Columbia.\\n- Chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta): Known as dog salmon or calico salmon in some parts of the US, and keta in the Russian Far East.\\n- Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch): Also known as silver salmon.\\n- Masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou): Also known as cherry trout in Japan.\\n- Pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha): Known as humpback salmon or humpies in southeast and southwest Alaska.\\n- Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka): Also known as red salmon in the US, especially Alaska.\\n\n","8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Aquaculture is the culturing of fish, shellfish, aquatic plants, and/or other organisms in captivity or under controlled conditions in the near shore environment.

The three primary fish farming areas in Canada are British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador, and New Brunswick. In Newfoundland and Labrador and New Brunswick, the Provincial government is the primary regulator and leasing authority. The Province regulates the activity and operations of aquaculture and issues the Aquaculture License, Crown Land lease, and Water Use License where fish farms are located. In Newfoundland and Labrador, the Crown Land Lease for the site is issued for 50 years, the Aquaculture License is issued for 6 years, and the Water Use License is issued for 5 years. In New Brunswick, individual sites are typically granted a lease for 20 years. In British Columbia, Federal and Provincial authorizations are required to operate a marine fish farm site. The Federal Government regulates the activity and operations of aquaculture while the Provincial Government administers the Crown lands where fish farms are located. The Province grants a license to occupy an area of the ocean associated with the individual fish farming site. The tenured encompasses the rearing pens, ancillary infrastructure, and all moorings. Individual site tenures have a specific timeline ranging from five to twenty years.\n","10                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The three key indicators for projecting future fish harvest volumes are standing biomass, feed consumption, and smolt release. Standing biomass categorized by size is the best short-term indicator, while standing biomass, feed consumption, and smolt release are good indicators for medium- and long-term harvest. Smolt release data affects long-term volume estimates as it takes up to 2 years from smolt release to harvest. Variation in seawater temperature can impact the length of the production cycle and harvest volumes. A warmer winter can increase harvest volumes for the relevant year, partly at the expense of the subsequent year. Disease outbreaks can impact harvest volume due to mortality and growth slowdown.\n","11                                                                                                               Maximising survival and maintaining healthy fish stocks are primarily achieved through good husbandry and health management practices and policies, which reduce exposure to pathogens and the risk of health challenges. The success of good health management practices has been demonstrated on many occasions and has contributed to an overall improvement in the survival of farmed salmonids. Fish health management plans, veterinary health plans, biosecurity plans, risk mitigation plans, contingency plans, disinfection procedures, surveillance schemes, as well as coordinated and synchronised zone/area management approaches, all support healthy stocks with an emphasis on disease prevention. Prevention of many diseases is achieved through vaccination at an early stage and while the salmon are in freshwater. Vaccines are widely used commercially to reduce the risk of health challenges. With the introduction of vaccines a considerable number of bacterial and viral health issues have been effectively controlled, with the additional benefit that the quantity of licensed medicines prescribed in the industry has been reduced. In some instances medicinal treatment is still required to avoid mortality and for the well-being and welfare of the fish. Even the best managed farms may have to use licensed medicines from time to time, if other measures are not sufficient.\n","12                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Atlantic salmon is a healthy product because is rich in long-chain omega-3, EPA and DHA, which reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

Trolling is often used in conjunction with other fishing techniques, such as bottom trawling or longlining, to increase the chances of catching fish.\n","3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Subsistence fishery is a type of fishing that is done for personal or family use rather than for commercial purposes. In Alaska, subsistence fisheries may not operate in \"nonsubsistence areas\" as designated by the state (AS 16.05.258(c)). Subsistence fishery is a fishery in which fishes or other seafood are harvested for noncommercial, customary and traditional uses. These uses include direct personal or family consumption as food, shelter, fuel, clothing, tools, or transportation, for the making and selling of handicraft articles out of nonedible by-products of fish and wildlife resources taken for personal or family consumption, and for the customary trade, barter, or sharing for personal or family consumption. Fishery type is defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) as \".an activity leading to harvesting of fish. It may involve capture of wild fish or raising of fish through aquaculture.\"\n","4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The tags implanted in the fish’s abdominal cavity are usually small, round, and made of either metal or plastic. These tags are typically embedded under the skin and are not visible to the naked eye. Some examples of tags used for fish identification include:  - PIT tags: Passive Integrated Transponder tags are small, electronic chips that are implanted under the skin of the fish. These tags emit a unique code that can be read by a scanner, allowing researchers to identify individual fish. - Acoustic tags: These tags are similar to PIT tags but emit a sound signal instead of a code. Researchers can detect these signals using specialized equipment, allowing them to track the movements of tagged fish. - Radio tags: These tags emit a radio signal that can be detected by a receiver. Like acoustic tags, radio tags allow researchers to track the movements of tagged fish. - Visual tags: These tags are attached to the outside of the fish and are visible to the naked eye. They may be made of metal, plastic, or other materials and can be used to identify individual fish.  It’s important to note that the specific type of tag used for fish identification can vary depending on the species being studied and the purpose of the study. For example, some tags may be designed to last longer than others, while others may be more suitable for tracking fish in certain environments.  In conclusion, the tags implanted in the fish’s abdominal cavity are typically small, electronic devices that are used to identify individual fish. These tags can be made of metal or plastic and may be embedded under the skin or attached to the outside of the fish. The specific type of tag used can vary depending on the species being studied and the purpose of the study.  \n","5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The length measurement type used for tuna is fork length. Fork length is the distance from the tip of the snout to the fork of the tail. It is the most commonly used length measurement type for tuna. Automatic methods used for tuna length measurement include image processing techniques such as Hough transform, image thinning, and best fitting rectangle. These methods use computer vision algorithms to automatically detect and measure the length of tuna from images or videos. Other methods include Hsiu method, grade-3 polynomial regression, and lightbox. However, these methods have not been widely used for tuna length measurement due to their limitations and challenges.\n","6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The salmon life cycle consists of several stages, including egg, alevin, smolt, fry, adult, juvenile, parr, jack, grilse, and more. Each stage has unique characteristics and behaviors that help the salmon survive and thrive in its environment.  Egg: The egg stage begins when the female salmon releases her eggs into the water. The eggs are fertilized by the male salmon and then attach to rocks or other objects in the streambed. The eggs hatch after a few weeks, and the alevins emerge.  Alevin: The alevin stage is characterized by the presence of a yolk sac that provides nutrients to the developing fish. The alevins remain attached to the streambed until they absorb their yolk sacs and become free-swimming fry.  Smolt: The smolt stage occurs when the salmon transforms from a parr to a smolt. This transformation involves changes in coloration, behavior, and physiology that prepare the salmon for its journey to the ocean.  Fry: Fry are young salmon that have recently emerged from the gravel and are still dependent on their yolk sacs for nutrition. They are typically found in shallow waters near the shoreline.  Adult: Adult salmon are fully developed and capable of reproducing. They spend most of their lives in the ocean, returning to freshwater streams to spawn.  Juvenile: Juvenile salmon are young fish that have not yet reached sexual maturity. They are typically found in freshwater streams and rivers.  Parr: Parr are young salmon that have not yet transformed into smolts. They are typically found in freshwater streams and rivers.  Jack: Jacks are precocious male salmon that have spent one winter less in the ocean than the youngest females of a given species. They are smaller than other age classes of conspecifics and have unique coloration.  Grilse: Grilse are young Atlantic salmon that return to their native river to spawn for the first time after one winter at sea.  Overall, the salmon life cycle is complex and involves many stages that require specific adaptations and behaviors to ensure survival and successful reproduction.\n","7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                List all pacific salmon species.

It is an important source of fish for human consumption, providing about half of the world's fish supply. Fish farming is a major contributor to the world's economy, with an annual value of around $10 billion. The most common fish species farmed are tilapia, catfish, sea bass, carp and bream.\n","9      There are several regulations for fish farming in Canada based on geographical area. In British Columbia, the federal government regulates the activity and operations of aquaculture, while the provincial government administers the crown lands where fish farms are located. The provincial government grants a license to occupy an area of the ocean associated with the individual fish farming site. The tenured encompasses the rearing pens, ancillary infrastructure, and all moorings. The term of tenure is based upon the provincial policy at the time of offer. In 2024, the annual fee for a typical 35 hectares tenure is $2,200 CAD per year. This fee is calculated based on the tenure size and a provincially indexed land value. Each tenure license contains a renewal provision once expired. After the tenure term has expired, it becomes a month to month occupancy until it is either renewed or returned to the Crown. It is uncommon for a tenure to not be renewed, however breaches to a tenure agreement can result in non-renewal. The production limitations in Canada are regulated as either a \"Maximum Allowable Biomass\" or a fixed number of smolt per cycle. \"MAB\" is specific to each Aquaculture license in British Columbia. Smaller farms are typically licensed for 2,200mt. with larger capacity facilities licensed to produce 5,000 mt. per cycle. In Newfoundland and Labrador and New Brunswick, a maximum number of smolt per cycle is given to a farm. Farms are typically licensed for 600,000 to 1,000,000 smolt per cycle in Newfoundland and Labrador, and 250,000 to 600,000 smolt per cycle in New Brunswick. In Newfoundland and Labrador and New Brunswick, the provincial government is the primary regulator and leasing authority. The Province regulates the activity and operations of aquaculture and issues the Aquaculture License, Crown Land lease, and Water Use License where fish farms are located. In Newfoundland and Labrador, the Crown Land Lease for the site is issued for 50 years, the Aquaculture License is issued for six years, and the Water Use License is issued for five years. All Commercial Aquaculture Licenses are renewable but may be lost or suspended for non-compliance issues and non-payment of fees.

Smolt release data affects long-term volume estimates by providing information about the number of fish released into the ocean, which can help predict future harvests. Seawater temperature can also impact production cycle length and harvest volumes, as warmer water can lead to faster growth rates and shorter production cycles. Disease outbreaks can impact fish harvest volumes by causing mortality and slowing down growth rates.\n","11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Husbandry and health practices play a crucial role in maximizing salmon survival and maintaining healthy fish stocks.

Each stage has unique characteristics and behaviors that help the salmon survive and thrive in its environment.  Egg: The egg stage begins when the female salmon releases her eggs into the water. The eggs are fertilized by the male salmon and then attach to rocks or other objects in the streambed. The eggs hatch after a few weeks, and the alevins emerge.  Alevin: The alevin stage is characterized by the presence of a yolk sac that provides nutrients to the developing fish. The alevins remain attached to the streambed until they absorb their yolk sacs and become free-swimming fry.  Smolt: The smolt stage occurs when the salmon transforms from a parr to a smolt. This transformation involves changes in coloration, behavior, and physiology that prepare the salmon for its journey to the ocean.  Fry: Fry are young salmon that have recently emerged from the gravel and are still dependent on their yolk sacs for nutrition. They are typically found in shallow waters near the shoreline.  Adult: Adult salmon are fully developed and capable of reproducing. They spend most of their lives in the ocean, returning to freshwater streams to spawn.  Juvenile: Juvenile salmon are young fish that have not yet reached sexual maturity. They are typically found in freshwater streams and rivers.  Parr: Parr are young salmon that have not yet transformed into smolts. They are typically found in freshwater streams and rivers.  Jack: Jacks are precocious male salmon that have spent one winter less in the ocean than the youngest females of a given species. They are smaller than other age classes of conspecifics and have unique coloration.  Grilse: Grilse are young Atlantic salmon that return to their native river to spawn for the first time after one winter at sea.  Overall, the salmon life cycle is complex and involves many stages that require specific adaptations and behaviors to ensure survival and successful reproduction.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>7</th>\n","      <td>List all pacific salmon species.

In British Columbia, the federal government regulates the activity and operations of aquaculture, while the provincial government administers the crown lands where fish farms are located. The provincial government grants a license to occupy an area of the ocean associated with the individual fish farming site. The tenured encompasses the rearing pens, ancillary infrastructure, and all moorings. The term of tenure is based upon the provincial policy at the time of offer. In 2024, the annual fee for a typical 35 hectares tenure is $2,200 CAD per year. This fee is calculated based on the tenure size and a provincially indexed land value. Each tenure license contains a renewal provision once expired. After the tenure term has expired, it becomes a month to month occupancy until it is either renewed or returned to the Crown. It is uncommon for a tenure to not be renewed, however breaches to a tenure agreement can result in non-renewal. The production limitations in Canada are regulated as either a \"Maximum Allowable Biomass\" or a fixed number of smolt per cycle. \"MAB\" is specific to each Aquaculture license in British Columbia. Smaller farms are typically licensed for 2,200mt. with larger capacity facilities licensed to produce 5,000 mt. per cycle. In Newfoundland and Labrador and New Brunswick, a maximum number of smolt per cycle is given to a farm. Farms are typically licensed for 600,000 to 1,000,000 smolt per cycle in Newfoundland and Labrador, and 250,000 to 600,000 smolt per cycle in New Brunswick. In Newfoundland and Labrador and New Brunswick, the provincial government is the primary regulator and leasing authority. The Province regulates the activity and operations of aquaculture and issues the Aquaculture License, Crown Land lease, and Water Use License where fish farms are located. In Newfoundland and Labrador, the Crown Land Lease for the site is issued for 50 years, the Aquaculture License is issued for six years, and the Water Use License is issued for five years. All Commercial Aquaculture Licenses are renewable but may be lost or suspended for non-compliance issues and non-payment of fees.
