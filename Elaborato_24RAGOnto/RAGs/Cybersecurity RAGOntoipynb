GuidancesThreat DataResourcesAbout Us\\n\\nContact Us\\n\\nIn-Depth Analysis\\n\\nLookout\\n\\nMalware\\n\\nSpyware\\n\\nApril 15, 2020\\n\\n# Nation-State Mobile Malware Targets Syrians with COVID-19 Lures\\n\\nLookout researchers have uncovered a long-running surveillance campaign tied\\nto Syrian nation-state actors, which recently started using the novel\\ncoronavirus as its newest lure to entice its targets to download malware.\\n\\nThis campaign appears to have been active since the start of January 2018, and\\ntargets Arabic-speaking users, likely in Syria and the surrounding region.\\nNone of these apps were available on the official Google Play Store,\\nsuggesting they were likely distributed through actor-operated watering holes\\nor third-party app stores. Lookout previously reported on another\\nsurveillanceware campaign using COVID-19 related lures targeting Libya.\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\n _Applications from this surveillance campaign impersonate a variety of\\napplications, with titles such as “Covid19”, “Telegram Covid_19”, “Android\\nTelegram”, and “Threema Arabic” (an end-to-end encrypted messaging\\napplication), as well as a phone signal booster and OfficeSuite application.\\nPackage names also allude to Syrian targeting, with names such as\\n“com.syria.tel”, “syria.tel.ctu”, and “com.syriatel.ctu”._\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\n## Syrian connections\\n\\nLookout researchers found 71 malicious Android applications connected to the\\nsame command-and-control (C2) server. The IP address of the C2 server is\\nlocated in a block of addresses held by Tarassul Internet Service Provider, an\\nISP owned by – and sharing network infrastructure with – the Syrian\\nTelecommunications Establishment (STE) (Freedom House, 2018). STE has a\\nhistory of hosting infrastructure for the Syrian Electronic Army (SEA), a\\nSyrian state-sponsored hacking group. Notably, the C2 servers of SilverHawk,\\nan Android malware family previously reported on by Lookout researchers, were\\nlocated on IP addresses belonging to STE.\\n\\nNot all applications in this campaign were completely scrubbed of sensitive\\ninformation when they were created.  A large portion of the malicious\\napplications are SpyNote samples, which store C2 information, along with user\\ninputted names, version numbers, and other information, in\\nres/values/strings.xml. In the strings.xml files of these applications, 22\\nAPKs reference “Allosh”, a name previously used in connection with a known\\nSyrian Electronic Army persona.\\n\\nPrevious strings appearing in other malware associated with the Syrian\\nElectronic Army contain this name, such as “c:\\\\users\\\\allosh\\nhacker\\\\documents\\\\visual studio\\n2012\\\\Projects\\\\allosh\\\\allosh\\\\obj\\\\Debug\\\\Windows.pdb” mentioned in reporting by\\nCitizen Lab on the SEA malicious repackaging of the Psiphon 3 circumvention\\ntool, and “c:\\\\Users\\\\Allosh Hacker\\\\Desktop\\\\Application\\\\obj\\\\Debug\\\\Clean\\nApplication.pdb” from pdb paths discovered in binaries associated with\\nSilverHawk infrastructure.\\n\\n               \\n\\n_Screenshot of a strings.xml file, and all unique personas discovered in this\\ncampaign._\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\nThe Syrian Electronic Army has been active recently, with one of their Twitter\\naccounts claiming responsibility this month for DDoS attacks against Belgian\\nmedia, as well as defacing PayPal and eBay websites as recently as April 7,\\n2020.\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\n _Two of the most recent claims by @Official_SEA7, one of the Syrian\\nElectronic Army’s multiple Twitter accounts which has been active since 2013._\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\nSyrian authorities are known to heavily censor their country’s internet, with\\nSyria ranking 174th on Reporters Without Borders 2019 World Press Freedom\\nIndex. In addition, according to the 2018 Freedom of the Net Report published\\nby Freedom House, an NGO which conducts research and advocacy on democracy,\\npolitical freedom, and human rights, “In areas controlled by the government,\\nthe Syrian Telecommunications Establishment (STE) serves as both an ISP and\\nthe telecommunications regulator, providing the government with tight control\\nover the internet Infrastructure. Furthermore, private fixed-line and mobile\\nISPs are required to sign a memorandum of understanding to connect to the\\ninternational internet via gateways controlled by the Syrian Information\\nOrganization (SIO)” (Freedom on the Net 2018).\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\n _After installation, the original Covid19 application hides its icon and only\\ndisplays the newly installed Degree Measure application._\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\nThe newly installed application (com.finger.body.temperature.ap) is a benign\\nprank - a fake digital thermometer that serves as a decoy. Meanwhile the\\nmalware continues to operate in the background.\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\n _The user holds down on the screen on the fingerprint and is informed that\\ntheir body temperature is 35°C._\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\nSome AndoServer samples are purely surveillanceware that do not even pretend\\nto be anything else, while others, like this sample here, contain legitimate\\napplications inside the malware, with the benign APK hidden in the res/raw\\nfolder.  \\n\\nAndoServer samples receive commands, and are capable of:\\n\\n  * Taking a screenshot\\n  * Getting battery levels and if the device is plugged in\\n  * Reporting location (latitude and longitude)\\n  * Getting a list of installed applications\\n  * Launching an application specified by the malicious actor\\n  * Checking the number of cameras on a device\\n  * Choosing a specific camera to access\\n\\n  * Creating a specific pop-up message (toast)\\n  * Recording audio\\n  * Creating a file on external storage\\n  * Exfiltrating call logs\\n  * Listing files contained in a specified directory\\n  * Calling a phone number\\n  * Exfiltrating SMS messages\\n  * Sending SMS to a phone number\\n  * Exfiltrating the contact list\\n  * Playing a ringtone and then sleeping\\n\\n           \\n\\nAndoServer malware has its C2 domain or IP address hard coded into the source\\ncode.  Each sample also has its own unique identifier string at the start of\\nits communication with C2 servers, that appears to be for the actor to monitor\\nwhich application in their arsenal is responsible for the compromise, as they\\ncan see the unique application installed by the specific victim. While not\\nalways the case, some unique identifiers are similar to the name of the C2\\ndomain, while other times they refer to the title of the application,\\nhighlighting another level of customization of this malware.\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\n## Prevalence of commercial surveillanceware\\n\\nOf the malicious applications in this campaign, 64 of 71 are SpyNote samples,\\na well known commercial surveillanceware family. The remainder belong to the\\nSandroRat, AndoServer, and SLRat families, of which the latter two have not\\nyet been publicly reported on.\\n\\nSLRat appears to have gained popularity since its developer first publicized\\nit in May 2016, advertising it as “the Best and Free android remote admin\\ntool”, while AndoServer has not yet been seen for sale or mentioned on public\\nforums.

We believe with high confidence that\\nthese surveillance tools are used by the advanced persistent threat group\\n(APT) Confucius, which first appeared in 2013 as a state-sponsored, pro-India\\nactor primarily pursuing Pakistani and other South Asian targets.1 2\\n\\nWhile primarily known for desktop malware, the Confucius group was previously\\nreported to have started leveraging mobile malware in 2017, with the Android\\nsurveillanceware ChatSpy.3 However, our discovery of SunBird and Hornbill\\nshows that Confucius may have been spying on mobile users up to a year before\\nit started using ChatSpy.\\n\\nTargets of these tools include personnel linked to Pakistan’s military,\\nnuclear authorities, and Indian election officials in Kashmir. Hornbill and\\nSunBird have sophisticated capabilities to exfiltrate SMS, encrypted messaging\\napp content, and geolocation, among other types of sensitive information.\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\n _SunBird has been disguised as applications that include:_\\n\\n  * _Security services, such as the fictional “Google Security Framework”_\\n  *  _Apps tied to specific locations (“Kashmir News”) or activities (“Falconry Connect” and “Mania Soccer”)_\\n  * _Islam-related applications (“Quran Majeed”)._\\n\\n_The majority of applications appear to target Muslim individuals._\\n\\nLookout named Hornbill after the Indian Grey Hornbill, which is the state bird\\nof Chandigarh and where the developers of Hornbill are located. SunBird’s name\\nwas derived from the malicious services within the malware called “SunService”\\nand the sunbird is also native to India.\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\n## Malicious functionality and impact of both SunBird and Hornbill\\n\\nHornbill and SunBird have both similarities and differences in the way they\\noperate on an infected device. While SunBird features remote access trojan\\n(RAT) functionality – a malware that can execute commands on an infected\\ndevice as directed by an attacker – Hornbill is a discreet surveillance tool\\nused to extract a selected set of data of interest to its operator.\\n\\nBoth of the malware can exfiltrate a wide range of data, such as:\\n\\n  * Call logs\\n  * Contacts\\n  * Device metadata including phone number, IMEI/Android ID, Model and Manufacturer and Android version\\n  * Geolocation\\n  * Images stored on external storage\\n  * WhatsApp voice notes, if installed\\n\\nBoth malware are also able to perform the following actions on device:\\n\\n  * Request device administrator privileges\\n  * Take screenshots, capturing whatever a victim is currently viewing on their device\\n  * Take photos with the device camera\\n  * Record environment and call audio\\n  * Scrape WhatsApp messages and contacts via accessibility services\\n  * Scrape WhatsApp notifications via accessibility services\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\n## SunBird-specific functionality\\n\\nSunBird has a more extensive set of malicious capabilities than Hornbill. It\\nattempts to upload all data it has access to at regular intervals to its\\ncommand and control (C2) servers. Locally on the infected device, the data is\\ncollected in SQLite databases which are then compressed into ZIP files as they\\nare uploaded to C2 infrastructure.\\n\\nSunBird can exfiltrate the following list of data, in addition to the list\\nabove:\\n\\n  * List of installed applications\\n  * Browser history\\n  * Calendar information\\n  * BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) audio files, documents and images\\n  * WhatsApp Audio files, documents, databases, voice notes and images\\n  * Content sent and received via IMO instant messaging application\\n\\nIn addition to the list of actions above, SunBird can also perform the\\nfollowing actions:\\n\\n  * Download attacker specified content from FTP shares\\n  * Run arbitrary commands as root, if possible\\n  * Scrape BBM messages and contacts via accessibility services\\n  * Scrape BBM notifications via accessibility services\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\n _Samples of SunBird have been found hosted on third-party app stores,\\nindicating one possible distribution mechanism. Considering many of these\\nmalware samples are trojanized – as in they contain complete user\\nfunctionality – social engineering may also play a part in convincing targets\\nto install the malware. No use of exploits was observed directly by Lookout\\nresearchers._\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\n## Hornbill-specific functionality\\n\\nIn contrast, Hornbill is more of a passive reconnaissance tool than SunBird.\\nNot only does it target a limited set of data, the malware only uploads data\\nwhen it initially runs and not at regular intervals like SunBird. After that,\\nit only uploads changes in data to keep mobile data and battery usage low. The\\nupload occurs when data monitored by Hornbill changes, such as when SMS, or\\nWhatsApp notifications are received or calls are made from the device.\\n\\nHornbill is keenly interested in the state of an infected device and closely\\nmonitors the use of resources. For example, if the device is low on memory, it\\ntriggers the garbage collector. In addition to the list of exfiltrated data\\nmentioned earlier, Hornbill also collects hardware information. For example,\\nthe malware can check if a device’s screen is locked, the amount of available\\ninternal and external storage and whether WiFi and GPS are enabled.\\n\\nHornbill only logs location information if it deems the changes to be\\nsignificant enough from the previously recorded location – if the difference\\nbetween the corresponding latitudes and longitudes differ by more than 0.0006\\nwhich is roughly 70 metres.\\n\\nData collected by Hornbill is stored in hidden folders on external storage.\\nOnce call recordings or audio recordings are uploaded to C2 infrastructure\\nthey are deleted from the device to avoid suspicion.\\n\\nLocation on External Storage | Type of Data Collected  \\n---|---  \\n/sdcard/.system0/.ia | Audio (environment) recordings  \\n/sdcard/.system0/.cr | Call recordings  \\n/sdcard/.system0/.tempo | Temporary location used for testing upload to C2 infrastructure  \\n/sdcard/.system0/.is/.iss | Screenshots  \\n/sdcard/.system0/.is/.ifcc | Front camera “clicks” (photos)  \\n/sdcard/.system0/.is/.ircc | Rear camera “clicks” (photos)  \\n  \\n\\u200d\\n\\nHornbill uses a unique set of server paths to communicate to C2\\ninfrastructure. These are listed below along with what action Hornbill takes\\nwhen sending HTTP POST requests to each.\\n\\nUnique Server Paths | Action  \\n---|---  \\n/SignUp | Registers either a Device ID or User ID with a hardcoded password for further data exfiltration  \\n/UploadFile | Uploads file  \\n/SaveMessages | Bulk saves messages  \\n/SaveCallLogs | Bulk saves call logs  \\n/SaveContactDetails | Bulk saves contacts  \\n/SaveGpsDetails | Bulk saves GPS location  \\n/UpdateMobileState | Saves directory structure  \\n/UpdateMobileState | Queries C2 for queued and removed commands  \\n  \\n\\u200d\\n\\nThe operators behind Hornbill are extremely interested in a user’s WhatsApp\\ncommunications. In addition to exfiltrating message content and sender\\ninformation of messages, Hornbill records WhatsApp calls by detecting an\\nactive call by abusing Android’s accessibility services. The exploitation of\\nAndroid’s accessibility services in this manner is a trend we are observing\\nfrequently in Android surveillanceware. This enables the threat actor to avoid\\nthe need for privilege escalation on a device.\\n\\nLastly, Hornbill searches for and monitors activity on any documents stored on\\nexternal storage with the following suffixes: \".doc\", \".pdf\", \".ppt\", \".docx\",\\n\".xlsx\", \".txt\". Whenever a document is created, opened, closed, modified,\\nmoved or deleted, this action is logged by Hornbill. Functionality exists to\\nmodify this list of suffixes, but is incomplete in the samples we have\\nobserved. The latest samples of Hornbill show that this malware threat may\\nstill be under development.\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\n## Development timelines\\n\\nThe newest Hornbill sample was identified by Lookout’s app analysis engine as\\nrecently as December 2020, suggesting the malware may still be active today.\\nBoth ChatSpy and Hornbill’s packaging dates appeared to have been tampered\\nwith, but we first observed them in January 2018 and May 2018 respectively.\\n\\nLookout first observed SunBird in January 2017, but unlike the other two\\nmalware families, the packaging dates appear legitimate, indicating the\\nmalware was likely in development between December 2016 and early 2019.\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\n _Hornbill, which Lookout first saw in May 2018, is actively deployed. We\\nobserved new samples as recently as December 2020. The first SunBird sample\\nwas seen as early as 2017 and as late as December 2019._\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\n## Targeting\\n\\nTo better understand who SunBird may have been deployed against, we analyzed\\nover 18GB of exfiltrated data that was publicly exposed from at least six\\ninsecurely configured C2 servers. All data uploaded to the C2 infrastructure\\nincluded the locale of the infected devices. This information, combined with\\nthe data content, gave us extensive insight into who was being targeted by\\nthis malware family and the kind of information the attackers were after.\\n\\nSome notable targets included an individual who applied for a position at the\\nPakistan Atomic Energy Commission, individuals with numerous contacts in the\\nPakistan Air Force (PAF), as well as officers responsible for electoral rolls\\n(Booth Level Officers) located in the Pulwama district of Kashmir.\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\n _Based on the locale and country code information of infected devices and\\nexfiltrated content, we think SunBird may have roots as a commercial Android\\nsurveillanceware. The data included information on victims in Europe and the\\nUnited States, some of which appear to be targets of spouseware or\\nstalkerware. It also included data on Pakistani nationals in Pakistan, India\\nand the United Arab Emirates that we believe may be targeted by Confucius APT\\ncampaigns between 2018 and 2019._\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\n## Malware development and commercial surveillance roots\\n\\nBoth Hornbill and SunBird appear to be evolved versions of commercial Android\\nsurveillance tooling. Hornbill seems to be derived from the same code base as\\na previously active commercial surveillanceware product known as MobileSpy. 5\\nIt is unclear how the developers of Hornbill acquired the code, but the\\ncompany behind MobileSpy, Retina-X Studios, shut down their surveillance\\nsoftware products in May 2018 after being hacked twice. 6 Links between the\\nHornbill developers indicate they all appear to have worked together at a\\nnumber of Android and iOS app development companies registered and operating\\nin or near Chandigarh, Punjab, India. In 2017, one developer claimed to be\\nworking at India’s Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) on\\ntheir LinkedIn profile.\\n\\nSunBird looks to have been created by Indian developers who also produced\\nanother commercial spyware product, which we dubbed BuzzOut. 7 The theory that\\nSunBird’s roots lay in stalkerware was also supported by the content found in\\nthe exfiltrated data we uncovered. The data included information on\\nstalkerware victims, as well as Pakistani nationals living in Pakistan and\\ntraveling in the UAE and India. This data suggests that SunBird could have\\nbeen sold to an actor that selectively deployed it to gather intelligence on\\ntargeted individuals. Similar behavior was observed with Stealth Mango and\\nTangelo, two nation state mobile surveillanceware Lookout researchers\\ndiscovered in 2018. 8\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\n## Exfiltrated data\\n\\nDuring this investigation, we were able to access exfiltrated data for SunBird\\nwhose C2 infrastructure had been insufficiently secured.\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\n _This is a breakdown of types of data SunBird exfiltrated. This data is from\\npublicly-accessible exfiltrated content exposed on SunBird C2 servers for 5\\ncampaigns between 2018 and 2019. We found another 12 GB of data exfiltrated on\\nanother C2 server 23.82.19[.]250. The default language of this server was set\\nup as Chinese when discovered by Lookout researchers. This may be a false flag\\nor may have been altered by a third party. This also makes it difficult to\\nconfirm if all of the data originated from infections of actual target\\ndevices._\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\n _Frequency of infected devices’ locale and country code settings (translated\\nto languages and countries) as packaged within publicly-accessible exfiltrated\\ndata. This data includes both the Confucius APT targets and spouseware victims\\nof SunBird._\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\n** _Left:_**_One particular SunBird C2 server was found to also be exposing a\\nlog file containing IP addresses of those that logged into the administrator\\npanel. The majority of these were distributed throughout\\nIndia._**_Right:_**_Geo-location data captured from a publicly-exposed\\ndatabase found on another Sunbird C2 IP 23.82.19[.]250. Almost all data stored\\non this server referenced phone numbers of various locations in northern\\nIndia. The second most common region for phone numbers was Pakistan._\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\nWithin the exfiltrated data, one particular victim caught our interest. This\\nindividual was using WhatsApp to correspond with someone applying for a\\nposition at the Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority in 2017. In 2018,\\nmessages were uncovered from someone applying for a position at the Pakistan\\nAtomic Energy Commission.9\\n\\nAdditional exfiltrated data from late 2018 and early 2019 indicated that\\nSunBird was being used to monitor Booth Level Officers10 responsible for\\nfield-level information regarding electoral rolls in the Pulwama district of\\nKashmir. This time and location is significant as Pulwama suffered a suicide\\nbombing attack in February 2019, which increased tensions between India and\\nPakistan. The start date of active monitoring of this target on C2 servers\\ncoincided with the start of the Indian general elections held in April 2019.\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\n _Continuous data exfiltration data that occurred every ten minutes stopped at\\nthe end of 2018. Aside from one brief upload in January 2019, it suddenly\\npicked up again on the 11th of April 2019. While this may be coincidence, this\\nis also the same day that the Indian general elections of 2019 began.12_\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\nA total of 156 victims were discovered in this new dataset and included phone\\nnumbers from India, Pakistan and Kazakhstan.\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\n## Confucius connection\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\n _Hornbill application icons impersonate various chat and system\\napplications._\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\nSimilar to previous Confucius tactics seen with ChatSpy, Hornbill samples\\noften impersonate chat applications such as Fruit Chat, Cucu Chat and Kako\\nChat. The related C2 infrastructure communicates on port 8080, a pattern also\\nseen on the desktop campaigns carried out by Confucius.14\\n\\nThe Confucius group is well known for impersonating legitimate services to\\ncover their tracks and confuse its victims. Naming malicious apps similar to\\nlegitimate ones may be an attempt to gain a target’s trust. For example, “kako\\nchat” may have been named due to its similarity to KakaoTalk.15 However, Kako\\nChat’s C2 server (chatk.goldenbirdcoin[.]com) references a defunct\\ncryptocurrency by the same name.16 Cucu Chat may refer to a seemingly benign\\ndating app of the same name that is available on third-party app stores such\\nas APKPure.17, 18 However, Cucu Chat communicates to the site\\nhttp://wangu[.]xyz19 (also on port 8080) and itself appears to be an\\nimpersonation of Wangu, an application which advertises itself as a chat app\\nfor Zimbabweans.20 The latest sample of Hornbill titled “Filos” trojanizes the\\nMesibo21 Android application for legitimate chat functionality.\\n\\nDuring our investigation, we noticed that Hornbill C2 infrastructure hosted\\nHTML resources consistent with a commercial spyware page, but missing its\\nimage resources.\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\n _C2 servers for Hornbill were found to host HTML content from a commercial\\nspyware._\\n\\nAdditionally, Hornbill carries out data exfiltration via the following unique\\nset of server paths:\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\nWe found that the patterns noted above also existed on another domain\\nsamaatv[.]online.

RedJuliett exploited known vulnerabilities in network\\nedge devices such as firewalls, virtual private networks (VPNs), and load\\nbalancers for initial access. The group likely operates from Fuzhou, China,\\naligning with its persistent targeting of Taiwan. RedJuliett’s activities\\nlikely aim to support Beijing's intelligence collection on Taiwan’s economic\\nand diplomatic relations, as well as critical technology development.\\n\\n**Chinese State-Sponsored RedJuliett Intensifies Cyber Espionage Against\\nTaiwanese Government, Academic, and Technology Sectors**\\n\\nRedJuliett’s focus on targeting Taiwanese entities aligns with the group’s\\npast activity. Insikt Group also observed RedJuliett expand its operations to\\ncompromise organizations in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Laos, South Korea, the United\\nStates, Djibouti, Kenya, and Rwanda.\\n\\nIn addition to targeting vulnerabilities in internet-facing devices,\\nRedJuliett also used structured query language (SQL) injection and directory\\ntraversal exploits against web and SQL applications. Organizations should\\ncomplement routine patching with defense-in-depth strategies focused on\\ndetecting post-exploitation persistence, discovery, and lateral movement\\nactivity to counter these threats. Organizations should also regularly audit\\ninternet-facing devices and reduce their attack surface where possible.\\nRedJuliett closely overlaps with public reporting under the aliases Flax\\nTyphoon and Ethereal Panda.\\n\\n**Key Findings**\\n\\n  * **Victim Organizations:** RedJuliett compromised 24 organizations, including government organizations in Taiwan, Laos, Kenya, and Rwanda. The group also conducted network reconnaissance or attempted exploitation against over 70 academic, government, think tank, and technology organizations in Taiwan, as well as multiple de facto embassies operating on the island.\\n  * **Exploitation Techniques:** RedJuliett created a SoftEther VPN bridge or client in victim networks. Additionally, the group conducted reconnaissance and attempted exploitation activity using Acunetix Web Application Security Scanners. RedJuliett also attempted SQL injection and directory traversal exploits against web and SQL applications. Post-exploitation, the group used open-source web shells and exploited an elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Linux operating system.\\n  * **Infrastructure:** RedJuliett administers operational infrastructure using SoftEther VPN, leveraging both threat actor-controlled leased servers and compromised infrastructure belonging to Taiwanese universities.\\n  * **Implications for Taiwan:** RedJuliett's activities align with Beijing's objectives to gather intelligence on Taiwan’s economic policy, trade, and diplomatic relations. The group also targeted multiple critical technology companies, highlighting the strategic importance of this sector for Chinese state-sponsored threat actors.\\n\\n**Recommendations for Organizations**\\n\\nOrganizations likely to be targeted by RedJuliett should adopt the following\\nmeasures:\\n\\n  1. **Network Segmentation:** Practice network segmentation by isolating internet-facing services in a demilitarized zone (DMZ).\\n  2. **Security Monitoring:** Ensure security monitoring and detection capabilities for all external-facing services and devices. Monitor for follow-on activities such as the use of web shells, backdoors, or reverse shells and lateral movement within internal networks.\\n  3. **Review Public Guidance:** Review public guidance on mitigating common TTPs used by Chinese state-sponsored groups and Insikt Group’s report on trends and recommendations for mitigating Chinese APT activity more broadly.\\n  4. **Risk-Based Patching:** Ensure a risk-based approach for patching vulnerabilities, prioritizing high-risk vulnerabilities and those being exploited in the wild, as identified by Recorded Future Vulnerability Intelligence.\\n  5. **Prioritize RCE Vulnerabilities:** Focus on addressing remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in popular VPN, mail server, firewall, and load-balancing appliances, particularly F5 BIG-IP, Fortinet FortiGate, and ZyXEL ZyWALL devices.\\n  6. **Malicious Traffic Analysis:** Monitor Malicious Traffic Analysis (MTA) to proactively detect and alert on infrastructure communicating with known RedJuliett command-and-control (C2) IP addresses.\\n  7. **Monitor Supply Chains:** Use Recorded Future Third-Party Intelligence to monitor real-time output and identify suspected intrusion activities involving key vendors and partners.\\n  8. **Threat Intelligence Extension:** Install the Recorded Future Threat Intelligence Browser Extension for instant access to threat intelligence from any web-based resource, enabling faster alert processing within security information and event management (SIEM) and prioritizing vulnerabilities for patching.\\n\\nInsikt Group anticipates that RedJuliett and other Chinese state-sponsored\\nthreat actors will continue to target Taiwan for intelligence-gathering,\\nfocusing on universities, government organizations, think tanks, and\\ntechnology companies. Chinese state-sponsored groups are expected to continue\\ntheir reconnaissance and exploitation of public-facing devices, a tactic that\\nhas proven effective in scaling their operations to gain initial access to a\\nbroad range of global targets.\\n\\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.\\n\\n## Appendix A — Indicators of Compromise\\n\\n**Active RedJuliett servers as of May 21, 2024:**  \\n38.147.190[.]192 (since 2024-04-07)  \\n61.238.103[.]155 (since 2024-02-23)  \\n122.10.89[.]230 (since 2024-01-24)  \\n137.220.36[.]87 (since 2024-05-09)  \\n140.120.98[.]115 (since 2023-11-14)  \\n154.197.98[.]3 (since 2023-11-14)  \\n154.197.99[.]202 (since 2023-12-16)  \\n176.119.150[.]92 (since 2024-04-01)  \\n  \\n**Known RedJuliett SoftEther TLS Certificates (SHA-1 Fingerprint)**  \\n7992c0a816246b287d991c4ecf68f2d32e4bca18  \\n5437d0195c31bf7cedc9d90b8cb0074272bc55df  \\ncc1f0cdc131dfafd43f60ff0e6a6089cd03e92f1  \\n2c95b971aa47dc4d94a3c52db74a3de11d9ba658  \\n0cc0ba859981e0c8142a4877f3af99d98dc0b707  \\n9f01fc7cad8cdd8d934e2d2f033d7199a5e96e4a  \\n  \\n**Domains:**  \\ncktime.ooguy[.]com  \\nwww.sofeter[.]ml  \\nwww.dns361[.]tk  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n\\n## Appendix B — Mitre ATT&CK; Techniques\\n\\n**Tactic: Technique** | **ATT &CK; Code**  \\n---|---  \\n**Resource Development:** Acquire Infrastructure: Virtual Private Server  | T1583.003  \\n**Resource Development:** Compromise Infrastructure: Server  | T1584  \\n**Reconnaissance:** Active Scanning: Vulnerability Scanning  | T1595.002  \\n**Initial Access:** Exploit Public-Facing Application  | T1190  \\n**Persistence:** External Remote Services  | T1133  \\n**Persistence:** Server Software Component: Web Shell  | T1505.003  \\n**Privilege Escalation:** Exploitation for Privilege Escalation  | T1068  \\n  \\nRelated\\n\\n~~~~\\n\\n~~~~\\n\\nAbout us\\n\\n  * Intelligence Cloud\\n  * Services & Support\\n  * Research\\n  * Resources\\n  * Company\\n\\nHelpful links\\n\\n  * Careers\\n  * Contact Us\\n  * Get a Demo\\n  * The Intelligence Graph\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nJoin us online\\n\\n  * ~~~~\\n\\n  * ~~~~\\n\\n  * ~~~~\\n\\n  * ~~~~\\n\\n  * ~~~~\\n\\nWant to learn more?\\n\\nContact us **today**\\n\\n~~~~\\n\\nCopyright © 2024 Recorded Future, Inc.\\n\\n  * Security FAQ\\n  * Cookies\\n  * Privacy Policy\\n  * Terms & Conditions\\n\\n\"),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/acr2018final.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='6\\n Cisco 2018 Annual Cybersecurity Report  | The attack landscapePart I: The attack landscape\\nAdversaries are taking malware to unprecedented levels of sophistication and \\nimpact. The growing number and variety of malware types and families perpetuate \\nchaos in the attack landscape by undermining defenders’ efforts to gain and hold \\nground on threats. \\nTHE EVOLUTION OF MALWARE\\nOne of the most important developments in the attack landscape in 2017 was the evolution of ransomware. The \\nadvent of network-based ransomware worms eliminates the need for the human element in launching ransomware \\ncampaigns. And for some adversaries, the prize isn’t ransom, but the destruction of systems and data. We expect to \\nsee more of this activity in the year ahead.\\nThey’re out there: Defenders should prepare to face new, self-propagating,  \\nnetwork-based threats in 2018\\n1 SamSam: The Doctor Will See You, After He Pays the Ransom,  Cisco Talos blog, March 2016: blog.talosintelligence.com/2016/03/samsam-ransomware.html.\\n2 Player 3 Has Entered the Game: Say Hello to ‘WannaCry,’  Cisco Talos blog, May 2017: blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/05/wannacry.html .\\n3 New Ransomware Variant ‘Nyetya’ Compromises Systems Worldwide,  Cisco Talos blog, June 2017: blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/06/worldwide-ransomware-variant.html .In 2017, adversaries took ransomware to a new level—\\nalthough it had been expected. After the SamSam campaign \\nof March 20161—the first large-scale attack that used the \\nnetwork vector to spread ransomware, thereby removing the \\nuser from the infection process—Cisco threat researchers \\nknew it would only be a matter of time before threat actors \\nfound a way to automate this technique. Attackers would \\nmake their malware even more potent by combining it with \\n“worm-like” functionality to cause widespread damage.\\nThis malware evolution was swift. In May 2017, WannaCry—  \\na ransomware cryptoworm—emerged and spread like wildfire \\nacross the Internet.2 To propagate, it took advantage of a \\nMicrosoft Windows security vulnerability called EternalBlue , \\nwhich was leaked by the hacker group Shadow Brokers in \\nmid-April 2017. \\nWannaCry had earned more than US$143,000 through bitcoin \\npayments at the point the wallets were cashed out. Given the \\ntimeline, and calculating accrual of the value on the bitcoin \\noriginally paid into the wallets at $93,531, Cisco threat researchers estimate that roughly 312 ransom payments  \\nwere made. As a comparison, the exploit kit Angler, when \\nit was active, was earning about $100 million per year as a \\nglobal business.\\nWannaCry did not track encrypted damage to and the \\npayments made by affected users. The number of users \\nwho received decryption keys after making a payment is also \\nunknown. (WannaCry is still propagating, and users continue \\nto pay ransoms—in vain.) Due to the very low performance \\nof WannaCry as ransomware, the U.S. government and \\nmany security researchers believe the ransom component \\nis effectively a smokescreen to conceal WannaCry’s true \\npurpose: wiping data. \\nNyetya (also known as NotPetya) arrived in June 2017.3  \\nThis wiper malware also masqueraded as ransomware and it \\ntoo used the remote code execution vulnerability nicknamed \\n“EternalBlue,” as well as the remote code execution \\nvulnerability “EternalRomance” (also leaked by Shadow \\nBrokers), and other vectors involving credential harvesting '),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/acr2018final.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content='7\\n Cisco 2018 Annual Cybersecurity Report  | The attack landscapeunrelated to the Shadow Brokers release.4 Nyetya was \\ndeployed through software update systems for a tax software \\npackage used by more than 80 percent of companies in the \\nUkraine, and installed on more than 1 million computers.5 \\nUkraine cyber police confirmed that it affected more than \\n2000 Ukrainian companies.6 \\nBefore the rise of self-propagating ransomware, malware \\nwas distributed in three ways: drive-by download, email, or \\nphysical media such as malicious USB memory devices. All \\nmethods required some type of human interaction to infect a \\ndevice or system with ransomware. With these new vectors \\nbeing employed by attackers, an active and unpatched \\nworkstation is all that is needed to launch a network-based \\nransomware campaign.\\nSecurity professionals may see worms as an “old” type \\nof threat because the number of worm-like Common \\nVulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) has declined as product \\nsecurity baselines have improved. However, self-propagating \\nmalware not only is a relevant threat, but also has the \\npotential to bring down the Internet, according to Cisco threat \\nresearchers. WannaCry and Nyetya are only a taste of what’s \\nto come, so defenders should prepare. \\nWannaCry and Nyetya could have been prevented, or their \\nimpact muted, if more organizations had applied basic \\nsecurity best practices such as patching vulnerabilities, \\nestablishing appropriate processes and policies for incident \\nresponse, and employing network segmentation.\\nFor more tips on meeting the threat of automated network-\\nbased ransomware worms, read Back to Basics: Worm \\nDefense in the Ransomware Age  on the Cisco Talos blog.\\n4 Ibid.\\n5 Ukraine scrambles to contain new cyber threat after ‘NotPetya’ attack,  by Jack Stubbs and Matthias Williams, Reuters, July 2017:  \\nreuters.com/article/us-cyber-attack-ukraine-backdoor/ukraine-scrambles-to-contain-new-cyber-threat-after-notpetya-attack-idUSKBN19Q14P .\\n6 The MeDoc Connection,  Cisco Talos blog, July 2017: blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/07/the-medoc-connection.htm l.\\n7 CCleaner Command and Control Causes Concern,  Cisco Talos blog, September 2017: blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/09/ccleaner-c2-concern.html .Security weak spot: the supply chain\\nThe Nyetya campaign was also a supply chain attack, one of \\nmany that Cisco threat researchers observed in 2017. One \\nreason Nyetya was successful at infecting so many machines \\nso quickly is that users did not see an automated software \\nupdate as a security risk, or in some cases even realize that \\nthey were receiving the malicious updates.\\nAnother supply chain attack, which occurred in September \\n2017, involved the download servers used by a software \\nvendor to distribute a legitimate software package known \\nas CCleaner.7 CCleaner’s binaries, which contained a Trojan \\nbackdoor, were signed using a valid certificate, giving users \\nfalse confidence that the software they were using was \\nsecure. The actors behind this campaign were targeting major \\ntechnology companies where the software was in use, either \\nlegitimately or as part of shadow IT. \\nSupply chain attacks appear to be increasing in velocity and \\ncomplexity. They can impact computers on a massive scale, \\nand can persist for months or even years. Defenders should \\nbe aware of the potential risk of using software or hardware \\nfrom organizations that do not have a responsible security \\nposture. Look for vendors that issue CVEs, are quick to \\naddress vulnerabilities, and consistently strive to ensure that \\ntheir build systems can’t be compromised. Also, users should \\ntake time to scan new software before downloading it to verify \\nthat it doesn’t contain malware.\\nNetwork segmentation of software that is not backed by a \\ncomprehensive security practice can help contain damage \\nfrom supply chain attacks, preventing them from spreading \\nthroughout an organization.'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/acr2018final.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='8\\n Cisco 2018 Annual Cybersecurity Report  | The attack landscape\\nWhy integrity in threat intelligence reporting matters\\nAll organizations that share threat information to customers or \\nthe public through any channel should employ guidelines that \\nhelp them ensure accuracy in their reporting. Even if all the \\nfacts aren’t clear, organizations can still communicate what \\nthey know—and avoid guessing. Being right is better than  \\nbeing first.\\nFor example, when the WannaCry attack unfolded in \\nMay 2017, there was initial confusion within the security \\ncommunity about how the ransomware worm was infiltrating \\nsystems. Multiple organizations in both the public and private \\nsector were reporting that the attack stemmed from a \\nphishing campaign and malicious email attachment. But the \\nnetwork-based threat was, in fact, scanning for and infecting \\nvulnerable, public-facing Microsoft Windows Server Message \\nBlock (SMB) Server ports. \\nCisco threat researchers quickly alerted the security \\ncommunity that the emails they thought were connected to the WannaCry campaign were likely spam emails from the \\nNecurs bot that were spreading “Jaff” ransomware. It was \\nseveral days before the security community was in agreement \\nthat the suspicious emails contained Jaff—not WannaCry. And \\nduring that time, users were acting on information that could \\nnot help them to avoid the fast-moving WannaCry campaign.\\nThe chaos following the advent of the WannaCry campaign \\nserves as a reminder that the security community must avoid \\ncommunicating inaccurate facts about the origin and nature \\nof cyber attacks. In the early hours of a campaign, the sense \\nof urgency to quickly stop adversaries and protect users can \\neasily result in the publishing—especially on social media—of \\ninformation that may create confusion and prevent users from \\ndefending their systems.\\nFor more on this topic, read the post  On Conveying Doubt   \\non the Cisco Talos blog.'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/acr2018final.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='9\\n Cisco 2018 Annual Cybersecurity Report  | The attack landscapeENCRYPTED MALICIOUS WEB TRAFFIC\\nThe expanding volume of encrypted web traffic—both legitimate and malicious—creates even more challenges and \\nconfusion for defenders trying to identify and monitor potential threats. Encryption is meant to enhance security, \\nbut it also provides malicious actors with a powerful tool to conceal command-and-control (C2) activity, affording \\nthem more time to operate and inflict damage. Cisco threat researchers expect to see adversaries increase their use \\nof encryption in 2018. To keep pace, defenders will need to incorporate more automation and advanced tools like \\nmachine learning and artificial intelligence to complement threat prevention, detection, and remediation.\\nA dark spot for defenders: encrypted malicious web traffic\\nCisco threat researchers report that 50 percent of global web \\ntraffic was encrypted as of October 2017. That is a 12-point \\nincrease in volume from November 2016 (see Figure 1). One \\nfactor driving that increase is the availability of low-cost or \\nfree SSL certificates. Another is Google Chrome’s stepped-\\nup practice of flagging unencrypted websites that handle \\nsensitive information, like customers’ credit card information, \\nas “non-secure.” Businesses are motivated to comply with \\nGoogle’s HTTPS encryption requirement unless they want \\nto risk a potentially significant drop in their Google search \\npage rankings. As the volume of encrypted global web traffic grows, \\nadversaries appear to be widening their embrace of \\nencryption as a tool for concealing their C2 activity. Cisco \\nthreat researchers observed a more than threefold increase \\nin encrypted network communication used by inspected \\nmalware samples over a 12-month period (see Figure 2).

When Cisco threat researchers analyzed malicious email attachments that were equipped with various \\nsandbox evasion techniques, they discovered that the number of malicious samples using a particular sandbox \\nevasion technique showed sharp peaks, and then quickly dropped. This is yet another example of how attackers are \\nswift to ramp up the volume of attempts to break through defenses once they find an effective technique.\\nMalware authors playing dirty tricks in defenders’ sandboxes\\nIn September 2017, Cisco threat researchers noted high \\nvolumes of samples where a malicious payload is delivered \\nafter a document is closed (Figure 16). In this case, the \\nmalware is triggered using the “document_close” event. The \\ntechnique works because, in many cases, documents are not \\nclosed after the document has been opened and analyzed in \\nthe sandbox. Because the sandbox doesn’t explicitly close the \\ndocument, the attachments are deemed safe by the sandbox, \\nand will be delivered to the intended recipients. When a \\nrecipient opens the document attachment, and later closes the document, the malicious payload is delivered. Sandboxes \\nthat don’t properly detect actions on document close can be \\nevaded using this technique.\\nThe use of the “document_close” event is a clever option \\nfor attackers. It takes advantage of the macro functionality \\nbuilt into Microsoft Office, as well as users’ tendency to \\nopen attachments that they believe are relevant to them. \\nOnce users realize the attachment is not relevant to them, \\nthey close the document, triggering the macros in which the \\nmalware is hidden.\\nFigure 16  High volume of malicious Microsoft Word documents using “close function calls” observed in September 2017\\n0 5K10K15K20K25K30K35K40K\\nMalicious Samples Total Samples2016 2017DecNovOct\\nJan\\nFeb\\nMar\\nApr\\nMay\\nJun\\nJul\\nAug\\nSep\\nOctFigure 16 High volume of malicious Microsoft Word documents using “close function calls” \\n    observed in September 2017\\nSource: Cisco S ecurity ResearchVolume'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/acr2018final.pdf', 'page': 22}, page_content='23\\n Cisco 2018 Annual Cybersecurity Report  | The attack landscapeThe spikes in malicious samples using different sandbox \\nevasion techniques point to malicious actors’ desire to follow \\na method that seems to work for them—or for other attackers. \\nAlso, if adversaries go to the trouble of creating malware \\nand associated infrastructure, they want a return on their \\ninvestments. If they determine that malware can slip through \\nsandbox testing, they will, in turn, increase the number of \\nattack attempts and affected users.Cisco researchers recommend using sandboxing that includes \\n“content-aware” features to help ensure malware that uses \\nthe tactics described above does not evade sandbox analysis. \\nFor example, sandboxing technology should show awareness \\nof the metadata features of the samples it is analyzing—such \\nas determining whether the sample includes an action upon \\nclosing of the document.Some attackers evade sandboxing by disguising the type of \\ndocument in which the malicious payload exists.

Common \\nexamples include:\\nDNS amplification reflective attacks \\nThis sophisticated denial of service attack takes advantage \\nof a DNS server’s behavior to amplify the attack. A standard \\nDNS request is smaller than the DNS reply. In a DNS \\namplification reflective attack, the attacker carefully selects \\na DNS query that results in a lengthy reply that’s up to 80 \\ntimes longer than the request (for example, “ANY”). The \\nattacker sends this query using a botnet to third-party \\nDNS servers while spoofing the source IP address with the \\ntarget user’s IP address. The third-party DNS servers send \\ntheir responses to the target’s IP address. With this attack \\ntechnique, a relatively small botnet can channel a volumetric \\nflood of large responses toward the target.\\nNTP reflection \\nThis type of amplification attack exploits publicly accessible \\nNetwork Time Protocol (NTP) servers to overwhelm and \\nexhaust defenders with UDP traffic. NTP is an old networking \\nprotocol for clock synchronization between computer systems \\nover packet-switched networks. It is still widely used across \\nthe Internet by desktops, servers, and even phones to keep \\ntheir clocks in sync. Several old versions of NTP servers \\ncontain a command called monlist, which sends the requester \\na list of up to the last 600 hosts that connected to the  \\nqueried server.In a basic scenario, the attacker repeatedly sends the “get \\nmonlist” request to a random NTP server and spoofs the \\nsource IP address for the requesting server as the target \\nserver. NTP server responses are then directed to the target \\nserver to cause a significant increase in UDP traffic from \\nsource port 123. \\nSSDP reflection \\nThis attack exploits the Simple Service Discovery Protocol \\n(SSDP), which is used to allow Universal-Plug-and-Play \\n(UPnP) devices to broadcast their existence. It also helps \\nto enable discovery and control of networked devices and \\nservices, such as cameras, network-attached printers, and \\nmany other types of electronic equipment. \\nOnce a UPnP device is connected to a network, and after \\nit receives an IP address, the device is able to advertise \\nits services to other computers in the network by sending \\na message in a multicast IP . When a computer gets the \\ndiscovery message about the device, it makes a request for a \\ncomplete description of the device services. The UPnP device \\nthen responds directly to that computer with a complete list of \\nany services it has to offer.\\nAs with NTP and DNS amplified DDoS attacks, the attacker can \\nuse a small botnet to query that final request for the services. \\nThe attacker then spoofs the source IP to the target user’s IP \\naddress and aims the responses directly at the target.'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/acr2018final.pdf', 'page': 33}, page_content='34\\n Cisco 2018 Annual Cybersecurity Report  | The attack landscapeFigure 31  Overview of infrastructure blind spots across various industries\\nFigure 31  Overview of infrastructure blind spots across various industries\\n     \\nHealthcare Tech Finance Government Lumeta Actual Customers\\nPresumed endpoints\\nEndpoint visibility gap\\nUnmanaged networks\\nUnauthorized or unsecured forwarding devices\\nKnown but unreachable networksLeak paths to Internet identified on deployment 3000 220 120 940033,256 45 4 16,828520 420 75 20263278 771 24 512% 50% 33% 43%150,000 600,000 60,000 8000\\nDiscovered endpoints 170,000 1,200,000 89,860 14,000\\nSource: LumetaDefenders must remediate “leak paths” \\nA “leak path,” as defined by Cisco partner Lumeta, is a policy \\nor segmentation violation or unauthorized or misconfigured \\nconnection created to the Internet on an enterprise network, \\nincluding from the cloud, that allows traffic to be forwarded \\nto a location on the Internet—such as a malicious website. \\nThese unexpected connections can also occur internally \\nbetween two different network segments that should not \\nbe communicating with each other.

Teams \\ncould, for example, request that vendors provide secure \\ndevelopment lifecycle statements.\\nAnother best practice for vetting third-party software is \\nhelping to ensure that auto-update or check-for-update \\nfeatures are running securely. For example, when an update \\nis initiated, security professionals should be certain that \\nthe communication for that software occurs over a secure \\nchannel (such as SSL), and that the software is digitally signed. Both are needed: If only digital signatures are used, \\nbut not a secure channel, an attacker could intercept traffic \\nand potentially replace an update with an older version \\nof the software that is digitally signed, but may contain \\nvulnerabilities. If only a secure channel is used, an attacker \\ncould potentially compromise the vendor’s update server and \\nreplace the update with malware.\\nSpectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities: proactive preparation can accelerate remediation\\nThe January 2018 announcement of the Spectre and Meltdown \\nvulnerabilities, which could allow attackers to compromise data \\non platforms running current-generation computer processors, \\nraised concerns about security professionals’ ability to protect \\ndata from attacks. The vulnerabilities could allow attackers to \\nview application data in memory on the chipset, with potential \\nfor widespread damage, since affected microprocessors are \\nfound in everything from mobile phones to server hardware. \\nThe threats posed by the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities \\nhighlight the importance of communicating with security \\norganizations about solutions such as patches—as well as \\nensuring that third-party providers, such as cloud and supply \\nchain vendors, are adhering to best practices for remediating \\ngaps in security posed by such vulnerabilities. Product \\nsecurity incident response teams, or PSIRTs (such as the \\nCisco PSIRT), are designed to respond quickly to vulnerability \\nannouncements, provide patches, and advise customers on \\nhow to avoid risks. Organizations need to plan for vulnerabilities like Spectre and \\nMeltdown to happen, instead of hoping they won’t occur. The \\nkey is preparing for such announcements, and having systems \\nin place to mitigate potential damage. For example, security \\nteams should proactively inventory devices under their control, \\nand document configurations in features in use, as some \\nvulnerabilities are configuration-dependent and impact security \\nonly when certain features are activated. \\nSecurity teams should also ask third-party vendors, such \\nas cloud providers, about their update and patching \\nprocesses. Organizations need to ask for transparency from \\ntheir cloud providers in terms of how they remediate such \\nvulnerabilities, and how quickly they respond to alerts.

(For more on this topic, see “They’re \\nout there: Defenders should prepare to face new, self-\\npropagating, network-based threats in 2018,” on page 6 .)\\nOn March 14, 2017, Microsoft issued a security update \\n(MS17-010) alerting users to a critical vulnerability in its \\nMicrosoft Windows SMB Server. Figure 37 shows how the \\nnumber of devices detected with the vulnerability spikes, and \\nthen gradually declines between mid-March and mid-April as \\norganizations scan their systems and apply the patch.However, a significant number of devices still remained \\nunpatched as of mid-April. Then, on April 14, Shadow \\nBrokers released the working exploit for targeting that known \\nvulnerability in various versions of Microsoft Windows.  \\nFigure 37 shows that the number of devices detected with the \\nvulnerability nearly doubled shortly thereafter.

The \\ndevices in the sample included IP-enabled HVAC systems, \\ndoor locks, fire alarm panels, and card readers. \\nThe researchers looked specifically for IoT devices \\nvulnerable to several known threats, including Devil’s Ivy \\nmalware that exploits a vulnerability in a piece of code called \\ngSOAP that is widely used in physical security products, \\nand Mirai, an IoT botnet that connects to targeted machines \\nthrough brute-force attacks against Telnet servers.Qualys detected 7328 devices in total, but only 1206 had \\nbeen fixed (see Figure 38). That means 83 percent of the  \\nIoT devices in the sample still have critical vulnerabilities. \\nWhile Qualys did not find evidence of threat actors actively \\ntargeting those vulnerabilities, organizations were still \\nsusceptible to attack. However, they do not seem motivated  \\nto speed remediation. \\nThere are several possible explanations for the patching \\ninertia, according to Qualys. Some devices may not be \\nupdatable, for example. Others may require direct support \\nfrom the vendor. Also, it is not always clear who inside  \\nthe organization is responsible for maintenance of IoT \\ndevices. For example, an engineering team that takes care of \\nthe company’s HVAC system may not be aware of IT risks  \\nthat could affect that system, or even that the system  \\nis IP-enabled.\\nMore concerning, though, is the low number of IoT devices that \\nQualys detected. The actual number is likely to be much higher \\nbecause organizations simply do not know how many IoT \\ndevices are connected to their network. That lack of visibility \\nputs them at serious risk of compromise (see page 34  for more \\non this topic).\\nA first step to addressing this issue is inventorying all IoT \\ndevices on the network.

Neutrino’s disappearance was \\nonly temporary: The exploit kit is still active but resurfaces \\nonly for short periods. Its authors rent it to select operators \\nin exclusive arrangements. This approach helps to contain \\nNeutrino’s activity so it doesn’t become too prevalent—and \\neasier to detect.\\nIn the Cisco 2017 Annual Cybersecurity Report , we explained \\nhow these dramatic changes in the exploit kit landscape \\npresented opportunities for smaller players and new entrants \\nto make their mark. But as of mid-2017, no one appears to \\nbe seizing them. Only a handful of exploit kits are active. RIG, \\nwhich has been a leading exploit kit for some time, is the most \\nvisible in the landscape; it is known to target vulnerabilities \\nin Adobe Flash, Microsoft Silverlight, and Microsoft Internet \\nExplorer technologies.\\nOverall, exploit kit activity has been declining dramatically \\nsince January 2016, as Figure 1 shows.\\nThis trend echoes what we observed after the author and \\ndistributor of the pervasive Blackhole exploit kit was arrested \\nin Russia.2 When Blackhole subsequently ceased operations, it had a tremendous impact on the exploit kit market, and it \\ntook time for new leaders to emerge. The big winner of that \\nrace was Angler, which took the sophistication of exploit kits \\nand drive-by downloads to a new level.3 \\nFigure 1  Exploit kit activity\\nSource: Cisco Security Research\\n2016  JanMarMay\\n2017  Jan MarMayJul Sep Nov\\nMonth02K\\n1K3K4K5K6KNumber of Blocks5799\\n4071\\n3650Angler and Nuclear\\nCease Operations\\nDownload the 2017 graphics at: cisco.com/go/mcr2017graphics'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/Cisco_2017_Midyear_Cybersecurity_Report.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content='10Cisco 2017 Midyear Cybersecurity Report\\nAttacker BehaviorAngler targeted many vectors. Its authors were innovative, \\nand they moved faster than everyone else in the marketplace \\nto include new vulnerabilities in their exploit kit. In many ways, \\nthey raised the bar for other players in the space—and drove \\ndata and technique-stealing between other kits determined to \\nstay competitive. Now that Angler is gone, innovation among \\nexploit kits appears to have hit a slump.\\nAngler’s exit is only one likely cause for this stagnation. \\nAnother is that Flash technology has become harder to \\nexploit. Flash vulnerabilities helped to grow and sustain the \\nexploit kit market for years. But heightened awareness about \\nthose vulnerabilities and faster patching by defenders make \\nthe software harder to exploit. Adversaries now often find they \\nmust target multiple vulnerabilities to exploit a system.\\nAutomatic security updates in modern operating systems and \\nweb browsers are also helping to shield users from exploit kit \\ncompromise. Another trend: Cybercriminals, likely in response \\nto the shifts in the exploit kit marketplace, have been turning \\nto (or back to) email to deliver ransomware and other malware \\nquickly and cost-effectively. They are also getting creative \\nwith their methods to evade detection. For example, Cisco \\nthreat researchers have observed growth in spam containing \\n4 “Threat Spotlight: Mighty Morphin Malware Purveyors: Locky Returns via Necurs,” by Nick Biasini, Talos blog, April 21, 2017: blogs.cisco.com/security/talos/locky-returns-necurs.macro-laden malicious documents, including Word \\ndocuments, Excel files, and PDFs, that can defeat many \\nsandboxing technologies by requiring user interaction to infect \\nsystems and deliver payloads.4 \\nA quiet evolution underway?\\nThere is little doubt that we will see a resurgence in the exploit \\nkit market, given that crimeware is an industry worth billions. \\nAs soon as a new attack vector emerges that is easy to exploit \\nand can affect users at scale, the popularity of exploit kits will \\nrise again—and so will competition and innovation.\\nDefenders must therefore remain vigilant. Many exploit kits \\nare still in operation and remain effective at compromising \\nusers and delivering malware to end systems. These threats \\ncan strike at any time in any environment. All it takes is one \\nvulnerability on one system for an exploitation to occur. \\nOrganizations that are diligent about patching vulnerabilities \\nswiftly—especially vulnerabilities in web browsers and \\nassociated browser plug-ins—and practice defense in depth \\ncan mitigate this risk.

As discussed in previous cybersecurity \\nreports from Cisco, Flash software has long been an \\nattractive web attack vector for adversaries who want \\nto exploit and compromise systems. However, it is \\nbecoming increasingly difficult to exploit due, in part, \\nto better patching practices.\\nResearch from network security and vulnerability \\nmanagement firm Qualys, a Cisco partner, shows that\\nFigure 2  Number of days required to patch 80% of  \\nFlash vulnerabilities\\nSource: Qualys\\n2014\\n2015\\n20160Days\\n365\\n73\\n146 21929262\\nDays80% of flash vulnerabilities defenders have significantly reduced the time needed to \\npatch 80 percent of known Flash vulnerabilities in their \\norganization from 308 days in 2014, to 144 days in \\n2015, to 62 days in 2016, on average (see Figure 2). \\nThe research is based on data sourced from the more \\nthan 3 billion vulnerability scans that Qualys conducts \\nannually across its global base. \\nAs defenders move faster to patch new vulnerabilities \\nin Flash software, some exploit kit authors might \\nshift their focus to exploiting older vulnerabilities that \\nmay have been overlooked. Security teams should \\ntherefore take time to assess whether all known \\nFlash vulnerabilities have been addressed, and to \\nprioritize patching critical vulnerabilities that place the \\norganization at risk.\\nAlso, some adversaries who have relied on exploit kits \\nthat target Flash software to deliver their ransomware \\nand other malware are likely to increase their use of \\nother techniques, at least in the short term, so that \\nthey can continue to meet their revenue targets.\\nFor example, Cisco threat researchers have observed \\ngrowth in spam emails with seemingly benign \\nattachments that contain malicious macros (see \\n“Malware evolution: A 6-month perspective,” page \\n23). That trend appears to coincide with the recent \\ndecline in exploit kit activity (for more on this topic, \\nsee “Exploit kits: Down, but not likely out,” page 9 ).'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/Cisco_2017_Midyear_Cybersecurity_Report.pdf', 'page': 11}, page_content='12Cisco 2017 Midyear Cybersecurity Report\\nAttacker BehaviorWeb attack methods provide evidence of a mature Internet\\n5 Note: In the Cisco 2017 Annual Cybersecurity Report  (available at b2me.cisco.com/en-us-annual-cybersecurity-report-2017?keycode1=001464153 ), Cisco threat researchers warned \\nthat malicious adware, which includes ad injectors, browser-settings hijackers, utilities, and downloaders, is a growing problem.

Today, defenders employ proxies in content scanning \\nto help detect potential threats looking for vulnerable Internet \\ninfrastructure or network weaknesses that allow adversaries to \\ngain access to users’ computers, infiltrate organizations, and \\ncarry out their campaigns. These threats include:\\n •Potentially unwanted applications (PUAs), such as \\nmalicious browser extensions\\n •Trojans (droppers and downloaders)\\n •Links to web spam and ad fraud\\n •Browser-specific vulnerabilities, such as JavaScript and \\ngraphics-rendering engines\\n •Browser redirects, clickjacking, and other methods used \\nto direct users to malicious web content\\nFigure 3 shows the most common malware types that \\nadversaries used from November 2016 through May 2017.

But no matter how they try to spin it, spyware is \\nnothing more than malware.\\nSpyware masquerading as PUAs is software that collects and \\ntransmits information about the user’s computer activities \\ncovertly. It is usually installed on a computer without the \\nuser’s knowledge. For the purposes of this discussion, we \\nput spyware in three broad categories: Adware, system \\nmonitors, and Trojans. \\nIn the corporate environment, spyware presents a range of \\npotential security risks. For example, it can:\\n •Steal user and company information, including personally \\nidentifiable information (PII) and other sensitive or \\nconfidential information.\\n •Weaken the security posture of devices by modifying their \\ndevice configurations and settings, installing additional \\nsoftware, and allowing third-party access. Spyware can \\nalso potentially enable remote code execution on devices, \\nallowing attackers to fully control the device.\\n •Increase malware infections. Once users are infected with \\nPUAs like spyware or adware, they are vulnerable to even \\nmore malware infections.\\nTo better understand spyware infections, Cisco researchers \\nstudied the network traffic of about 300 companies from \\nNovember 2016 to March 2017 to determine what types of \\nspyware families are present in organizations and to what extent. Through our research, we found that three spyware families \\naffected more than 20 percent of the companies in our sample \\nduring the period observed: Hola, RelevantKnowledge, and \\nDNSChanger/DNS Unlocker.

However, a threat that’s not nearly \\nas high-profile is raking in far more for its creators than \\nransomware: Business email compromise, or BEC. The risk \\nintelligence provider Flashpoint, a Cisco partner, has studied \\nthe BEC problem and has determined that it’s currently the \\nmost lucrative and profitable method to extract large amounts \\nof money from a business. It’s a deceptively easy attack \\nvector that relies on social engineering to trigger the theft.\\nAt its most basic, a BEC campaign involves an email \\n(sometimes using spoofing to appear as though it’s from a \\nco-worker) delivered to financial employees who can send \\nfunds by wire transfer. The adversaries have usually done \\nsome research on the company hierarchy and its employees—\\nfor example, using social network profiles to piece together \\nthe likely chain of command. The email may appear to be from \\nthe CEO or another top executive, asking the recipient to send \\na wire payment to a supposed business associate or to pay a \\nvendor. The message may express some urgency to compel \\nthe recipient to send the money, which typically ends up in \\nforeign and domestic bank accounts owned by cybercriminals.\\nBEC scams are aimed at big targets—and big targets have \\nfallen victim to them, even though such organizations may \\nhave mature threat defenses and safeguards against fraud. \\nBoth Facebook and Google have been victims of BECs and \\nwire fraud.12 Because BEC messages don’t contain malware \\nor suspect links, they can usually bypass all but the most \\nsophisticated threat defense tools. How bad is the BEC problem? The Internet Crime Complaint \\nCenter (IC3)—a partnership of the Federal Bureau of \\nInvestigation, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the National \\nWhite Collar Crime Center—reports that US$5.3 billion \\nwas stolen due to BEC fraud between October 2013 and \\nDecember 2016, an average of $1.7 billion per year13 (see \\nFigure 18). By way of comparison, ransomware exploits took \\nin about US$1 billion in 2016.14\\nU.S. victims of BEC fraud totaled almost 22,300 from October \\n2013 to December 2016.\\nFigure 18  Amount of loss due to BEC\\nSource: Internet Crime Complaint CenterOct 2 013Dec 2016$5.3\\nBillionFigure 18  Amount of loss due to BEC\\nDownload the 2017 graphics at: cisco.com/go/mcr2017graphics'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/Cisco_2017_Midyear_Cybersecurity_Report.pdf', 'page': 22}, page_content='23Cisco 2017 Midyear Cybersecurity Report\\nAttacker BehaviorCombating BEC fraud usually requires improvements in \\nbusiness processes, as opposed to threat defense tools. \\nFlashpoint recommends user education: For example, \\ntraining employees to identify out-of-the-ordinary requests \\nfor financial transfers, such as an out-of-country transfer \\nat a business that operates domestically. Organizations can \\nalso require employees to verify wire transfers with another \\nemployee—perhaps by phone—to bypass a spoofed email.\\n15 “Threat Spotlight: Mighty Morphin Malware Purveyors: Locky Returns via Necurs,” by Nick Biasini, Talos blog, April 21, 2017: blogs.cisco.com/security/talos/locky-returns-necurs .As for threat tools, sender policy framework (SPF) defenses \\ncan help block emails with spoofed addresses. However, \\norganizations may be hesitant to turn on this feature because \\nSPF can also block legitimate emails (such as marketing \\nmessages or newsletters) unless it is properly managed by IT.\\nThe bottom line is that organizations with an online presence—\\nfrom giants like Facebook and Google to businesses with just \\na few dozen employees—are potential targets for BEC fraud. \\nIt’s a low-cost, high-return approach for criminals, which \\nmeans it will likely grow as a threat vector.\\nMalware evolution: A 6-month perspective\\nCisco security researchers have been watching the evolution \\nof malware during the first half of 2017 and have identified \\nseveral trends that shed light on what malware authors are \\nthinking about most when developing their strategies—namely, \\ndelivery, obfuscation, and evasion.\\nTrend 1: Adversaries are using malware distribution \\nsystems that require users to take some type of positive \\naction to activate the threat\\nWe have observed an increase in malicious email attachments \\nthat are able to bypass automated malware detection \\nsystems. When placed in a sandbox environment, these \\nattachments do not show any evidence of being malicious, so \\nthey are forwarded to the user who may then encounter:\\n •A password-protected malicious document (with the \\npassword conveniently provided to the user in the body \\nof the email)\\n •A malicious document that presents a dialog box asking \\nfor the user’s permission (such as, “Click OK”) to take \\nsome type of action\\n •Malicious OLE objects in a Word document\\n •Malicious Word documents embedded in PDFs15 Trend 2: Adversaries are using ransomware codebases to \\ntheir advantage\\nMalicious actors are creating malware quickly, easily, and \\ncost-effectively by using open-source codebases, like Hidden \\nTear and EDA2, which publicly release ransomware code \\nfor “educational” purposes. Adversaries tweak the code \\nso it looks different from the original and then deploy the \\nmalware. Many of the “new” ransomware families Cisco threat \\nresearchers have observed in recent months are based on \\nopen-source code from educational codebases.\\nTrend 3: Ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) platforms are \\ngrowing fast\\nRaaS platforms, such as Satan, are ideal for lazy adversaries \\nwho want to enter the ransomware market and launch a \\nsuccessful campaign without having to perform any coding \\nor programming or devote resources to developing innovative \\ntactics. The operators of these platforms, which are growing \\nin number, take a cut of attackers’ profits.

It relies on PowerShell or WMI to run the malware \\ncompletely in memory without writing any artifacts to the file \\nsystem or registry, unless the attacker wants to put persistent \\nmechanisms in place.16 That makes the malware harder to \\ndetect. It also makes forensics investigations and incident \\nresponse more challenging.\\nTrend 5: Attackers are relying more on anonymized and \\ndecentralized infrastructure for obfuscation of command \\nand control\\nCisco threat researchers have observed an increase in the \\nuse of “bridging services” for facilitating access to malware \\n16 For more on this topic, see “Covert Channels and Poor Decisions: The Tale of DNSMessenger,” by Edmund Brumaghin and Colin Grady, Talos blog, March 2, 2017:  \\nblogs.cisco.com/security/talos/covert-channels-and-poor-decisions-the-tale-of-dnsmessenger .\\n17 For more on this topic, see “Go RAT, Go!

One example is Tor2web, a proxying service \\nthat allows systems on the Internet to access things that are \\nhosted within Tor, without requiring the installation of a local \\nTor client application.17\\nEssentially, Tor2web makes it easier for adversaries to use \\nTor without having to change their malware code or include a \\nTor client within their malware payload. Since an attacker can \\nconfigure a Tor2web proxy server on any domain they choose, \\nit is more difficult to block them as they are deployed.\\nThreat intelligence from Talos: On the trail of attacks and vulnerabilities\\nCisco’s Talos website ( blog.talosintelligence.com ) strives to \\nbe a source for vulnerability research and trends in the threat \\nlandscape. Vulnerability research is particularly important \\nbecause it highlights the struggle between attackers and \\ndefenders over time. \\nAttackers are usually considered to have an advantage \\nbecause they have time on their side, while defenders are at a \\ndisadvantage because they do not. Defenders are constrained \\nby the time needed to contain the damage caused by bad \\nactors. Vulnerability research allows defenders to get in \\nfront of weaknesses before attackers can exploit them. By \\nidentifying zero-day vulnerabilities and working with software \\nvendors to ensure that patches are developed and distributed, \\nresearchers can help close this gap.The security industry has become more adept at handling \\nransomware. Exploit kit activity has declined, allowing \\nTalos researchers to examine other threats. In short, the \\ninformation security industry has become more cognizant of \\nunderstanding how ransomware works and identifying new \\nransomware variants. \\nAnother key trend discussed on the Talos blog is adversaries’ \\nshift to email-based threats as they move away from exploit \\nkits. Since the once-dominant Angler exploit kit vanished in \\n2016, threat researchers have been watching to see if another \\nplayer will become the clear leader—or if other significant \\ntrends in the landscape emerge (see “Exploit kits: Down, but \\nnot likely out,” page 9 ).

Most email events for the Kryptik RAT \\ninvolved .zip, .js, or executable files.\\nWe also discovered that the Kryptik malware family was \\nemploying hashes of varying ages during the period \\nobserved (see Figure 23).\\nThe TTD trend for Kryptik shown in Figure 23 illustrates that \\nthe malware is difficult to detect, although Cisco products have \\nbeen identifying the threat more quickly in recent months. By \\nthe end of April 2017, our median TTD for the Kryptik RAT was \\nabout twice our overall median TTD of 3.5 hours (for more \\ndetails on how we calculate TTD, see page 26 ).

The downloader malware is \\nused to distribute ransomware and other threats, such as \\nbackdoor Trojans that facilitate credential theft or click fraud. \\nSome variants also serve as mechanisms for delivering the \\nNemucod malware payload. \\nThe way that Nemucod evolves likely has a lot to do with \\nits continued success. Figure 24 shows that Nemucod \\nconsistently uses 15 or more combinations of file extensions \\nand file content types. For example, 70 percent of Nemucod \\nweb events we observed involved JavaScript; the balance of \\nevents had .php (16 percent) or .zip file extensions (9 percent). \\nAdditionally, Nemucod events associated with email blocks \\nprimarily had .zip, .wsf (Windows script file), or .js files.\\nIn Figure 24, we see that Nemucod relies primarily on hashes \\nthat are less than a day old to keep ahead of defenders. \\nIn recent months, the malware has been increasing its use of \\nolder hashes. That may indicate that the security community \\nis becoming more effective at detecting new instances of \\nNemucod, so the malware authors may be reverting to older \\nhashes that have proven effective. Regardless, Figure 24 \\nshows that the TTD for Nemucod increased in March and April, \\nfurther exhibiting the push-and-pull between attackers and \\ndefenders. Whether it is related to how attackers are cycling \\nthrough hashes, their delivery methods, or other obfuscation \\nmethods, Nemucod’s authors apparently developed delivery \\nmechanisms that were harder to detect.

Today, Ramnit is one of the most persistent \\namong known banking Trojans. \\nIn our latest TTE study, we found that almost every web event \\n(99 percent) involving Ramnit malware had a text or HTML \\nMIME type.

This is likely due to \\ndefenders becoming more successful at detecting instances \\nof Ramnit that employed the older hashes. In fact, our median \\nTTD for Ramnit declined from just over 21 hours in March to \\nabout five hours by the beginning of May.

According to \\nAnomali’s threat researchers, most DGA domains observed \\nabout 5 years ago had a life span of 3 days or less.

Malware authors need to move fast enough to avoid \\nblocklists, but not so fast that defenders gain the upper hand \\nin blocking all new domains.\\nIn most cases, the algorithms behind the malware that \\ngenerate DGA domains vary just two elements when creating \\ndomains: The length of the domain name and the possible \\n19 For more information, see “How the ThreatConnect Research Team Used the Platform to Investigate Incidents, Identify Intelligence, and Conduct Pertinent Analysis Regarding Fancy Bear”: \\nthreatconnect.com/blog/how-to-investigate-incidents-in-threatconnect/ .top-level domains it can use. (Note: Nearly all algorithms use \\ndifferent approaches to randomize how they pick the letters in \\nthe second-level domain.)\\nThose limitations, combined with the need to generate \\nnew DGA domains constantly, result in malware families \\noften overlapping their efforts to generate and register DGA \\ndomains. They may end up colliding with each other in heavily \\nsaturated combinations like 8-10 character .com domains, for \\nexample. In such saturated spaces, a DGA domain could end \\nup on a blocklist due to a competitor’s use of a similar DGA \\ndomain that has been identified by defenders.\\nAnalyzing infrastructure broadens knowledge of attacker tools\\nAs discussed in the Security Capabilities Benchmark Study \\nfocus on verticals (see page 77 ), many security teams \\nstruggle to make sense of the thousands of security alerts \\nthey receive daily. Exploiting actors’ registration and hosting \\ntactics—specifically, the infrastructure in which bad actors \\noperate—can allow security professionals to zero in on the \\nsources of threats and block them. \\nIn an analysis of infrastructure used by the Fancy Bear \\ncyberespionage group, the research team at ThreatConnect, \\na Cisco partner and provider of the industry’s only extensible, \\nintelligence-driven security platform, identified potentially \\nmalicious domains, IP addresses, and aliases, helping \\ndefenders to take action before adversaries could break into networks.19 Not only is this approach proactive, it is also \\npotentially predictive, allowing vendors to gather advance \\nintelligence about adversaries.\\nThe domains and IP addresses analyzed were associated \\nwith spear-phishing attacks against Bellingcat, a citizen \\njournalist organization targeted by the Fancy Bear advanced \\npersistent threat (APT). ThreatConnect theorized that because \\nsome threat actors have access to limited IP infrastructure, \\nthey’ll host more than one of their domains on infrastructure \\nthey control. By studying these colocated domains, security \\nexperts can identify additional infrastructure (like domains and \\nIP addresses) that adversaries may control, and preemptively \\nblock or incorporate them into their defensive strategies.

ThreatConnect then used knowledge of \\nprevious Fancy Bear operations to assess that Fancy Bear \\nmost likely conducted the operations targeting Bellingcat.\\n •ThreatConnect used WHOIS registration information \\nto identify when a domain from the spear-phishing \\nmessages was registered and the email address that \\nregistered the domain, providing a time frame to use for \\nthe investigation.\\n •Using passive DNS, IP addresses were identified that \\nhosted the domain after it was initially registered. That \\nidentifies IP addresses that may be connected to the \\nbad actors.\\n •Using passive DNS once again, researchers identified \\nwhich IP addresses hosted less than a given arbitrary \\nnumber of domains to exclude IPs that may be hosting \\nmultiple domains for multiple customers. \\n •Using WHOIS and passive DNS, ThreatConnect identified \\nthe subset of those IP addresses that were probably \\ndedicated to the adversary—narrowing down the list of IP \\naddresses that likely could be attributed to the APT. \\n •From that subset of IP addresses, ThreatConnect then \\nused passive DNS to identify other domains hosted at the \\nsame IP address at the same time as the initial domain. \\n(If the domains are colocated with the initial domain at \\nthe same IP address, it identifies those that are possibly \\ncontrolled by the same APT.)\\n •ThreatConnect also identified other domains registered \\nusing the same email address used to register the original \\ndomain. When an email address is used to register a \\ndomain associated with APT activity, other domains \\nregistered with that email address could also be part of \\nthe APT’s activities.\\n •ThreatConnect used newly identified domains—those \\ncolocated with the original domain as well as those \\nregistered using the same email address—to feed \\nsubsequent iterations of the analysis.\\n •ThreatConnect then used passive DNS to identify any \\nknown subdomains for the identified domains. This \\ninformation can help identify mail servers or other subdomains \\nthat were not hosted on the same IPs as the identified \\ndomain, providing more avenues for further research.Figure 28  Colocation methodology\\n \\nSource: ThreatConnectWHOISPassive DNS\\nRegistrant \\nDomainsColocated\\nDomainsNecessary\\nInput Identify create dates \\nand registrants for \\ninput domain Domain or \\nSubdomain\\nDomain \\nColocation \\nTolerance (n)\\nIdentify the other \\ndomains that were \\nhosted at those IPs \\nduring the same \\ntime frame as the \\ngiven domainIdentify which of \\nthose IP addresses \\nare not sinkholes \\nor non-dedicated \\ninfrastructureIdentify IP addresses  \\nhosting domain \\nimmediately after \\ncreate date and \\nthe time frame for \\nthat hosting\\nIdentify those IP \\naddresses that \\nhosted (n) domains \\nor less during the \\nsame time frame as \\nthe input domain 1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\nIdentify the \\nregistrants for \\ninput domain \\nand colocated \\ndomains6\\nipdf.com\\n192.168.22\\n05-17-2017\\n192.168.22\\nFigure 28  Colocation methodology\\nDownload the 2017 graphics at: cisco.com/go/mcr2017graphics'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/Cisco_2017_Midyear_Cybersecurity_Report.pdf', 'page': 35}, page_content='36Cisco 2017 Midyear Cybersecurity Report\\nAttacker BehaviorAnalytic methodologies such as the one in Figure 28 can help \\nto identify an exponentially larger group of email addresses, \\nIP addresses, and domains that could be associated \\nwith encountered activity and considered suspect.

Mirai connects to victim machines through a brute-force \\nattack against Telnet servers, using more than 60 factory \\ndefault credentials of BusyBox software.\\n2. Every infected device locks itself against additional bots.\\n3. Mirai sends the victim’s IP and credentials to a centralized \\nScanListen service.26\\n4.

However, as \\noperations become increasingly intertwined, known security \\nweaknesses in devices and systems that were previously \\n“walled off” from each other now present even greater \\nrisk to organizations. For example, by using proven tactics \\nlike phishing emails to compromise users, adversaries can \\npenetrate a network, establish a foothold in a device with an \\noutdated operating system, and from there, move laterally \\nwithin the network to steal information, lay the groundwork for \\na ransomware campaign, and more.\\nThe recent WannaCry ransomware attack illustrated how \\nthe increasing interconnectedness of healthcare systems and weak security practices can put both organizations and \\npatients at risk. While it was not the first ransomware attack \\nthat appeared to target the healthcare sector, the campaign is \\nnotable in that it affected Windows-based radiology devices \\nat two U.S. hospitals.32\\nThreat researchers with TrapX Security, a Cisco partner that \\ndevelops deception-based cybersecurity defenses, warns \\nthat the targeting of medical devices with ransomware and \\nother malware is only going to expand.

They \\nare often running old and unpatched systems and are rarely \\nmonitored by hospital IT staff. Even when security teams are \\naware of vulnerabilities, they may not be able to act because \\nonly the vendor has access to those products. In other \\ncases, security teams must put patching on hold because \\nthe business simply cannot afford to take critical equipment \\noffline—even for a short period—or to risk compromising the \\neffectiveness of a device. And sometimes, the vendor and \\nother parties, including government agencies, must approve \\nany modifications to these devices, which can take years. The \\ncost of support for medical devices can also be very high.Many cybercriminals want to compromise medical devices, \\nwhich TrapX researchers say have become a key pivot point \\nfor attackers to move laterally within hospital networks. \\nAdversaries also know they are likely to see big returns from \\nransomware campaigns that hold lifesaving medical devices \\nfor ransom. More nefarious actors could also, potentially, take \\ncontrol of these devices—including implantable devices—and \\ndo harm to patients.\\nTrapX researchers recently investigated the exploitation of an \\noncology system with known Windows XP vulnerabilities. The \\nadversaries had infected three machines (one of which was \\nused to control a powerful laser), and turned one into a botnet \\nmaster that spread malware—a variant of Conficker—across the \\nhospital network (see Figure 37).\\nFigure 37  Oncology system exploit\\nSource: TrapXBack DoorRadiation\\nOncology\\nSystem\\nPosition\\nMGMT\\nRespiratory\\nFluoroscopic\\nRadiological\\nSystemTrapTrapSwitch Switch Switch\\nInternetAttacker\\nBack Door\\nBack DoorFirewallFigure 37  Oncology system exploit\\nDownload the 2017 graphics at: cisco.com/go/mcr2017graphics\\nAnother MEDJACK incident that TrapX recently investigated \\ninvolved a compromised MRI system.

Weak security \\npractices, such as not moving quickly enough to patch known vulnerabilities, not \\nlimiting privileged access to cloud systems, and leaving infrastructure and endpoints \\nunmanaged, are discussed. Also examined: How trends in the geopolitical landscape \\ncreate both challenges and opportunities for technology vendors and businesses.\\nGeopolitical update: WannaCry attack underscores risk of  \\nhoarding knowledge about exploitable vulnerabilities\\nEven before the massive WannaCry ransomware attack \\nin mid-May, global discussions about cybersecurity were \\nincreasing dramatically—and taking on a much more serious \\ntone. WannaCry only underscores how much work the global \\ncommunity has yet to do to reduce the threat, and impact, of \\nfuture malicious attacks by cybercriminals and nation-state actors.\\nCisco sees three key takeaways from this recent global attack:\\n1. Governments should report software flaws to vendors in \\na timely fashion and, to the extent that they exploit those \\nflaws, codify those decisions for independent oversight \\nand review.\\nOnly by creating greater transparency around exploitable \\nvulnerabilities can we ever hope to minimize their occurrence \\nand global impact. Governments should also adopt a well-\\nstructured and ongoing process that allows them to make \\nrisk-based decisions regarding how to handle and when \\nto release information about exploitable vulnerabilities to \\ntechnology developers and the public.\\n2. Technology developers should have publicly disclosed, \\nrisk-based mechanisms to receive, process, and disclose \\ninformation about the availability—or absence—of known \\nvulnerabilities, patches, mitigations, and workarounds.\\nBeyond providing security through the natural lifecycle of \\nproducts, technology developers should also communicate \\nto the public the how, what, why, and when of handling vulnerabilities. And they should strive to provide more \\ntransparency about co-development processes. Also, they \\nshould make sure users know precisely whom to contact to report \\nvulnerabilities so they can be publicized and fixed.\\n3. Business leadership must make cybersecurity a top priority.\\nCisco has long encouraged IT leadership in organizations to \\ntake every opportunity to educate their senior management \\nand the board of directors about the risks that malicious \\nattacks pose to the business, its employees and customers, \\nand its brand reputation. It’s time that message is shared, \\nheard, and acted on: Business leadership should set the tone \\nat the top about cybersecurity and emphasize its importance \\nto the entire organization. They should also ensure that \\nthe organization’s IT infrastructure is current and regularly \\nupdated—and that adequate budget is devoted to those \\nactivities (for more on this topic, see “Security leaders: It’s \\ntime to claim a seat at the top table,” on page 83 ).\\nThere is a legitimate debate to be had regarding how and \\nwhen governments share vulnerability information with the \\nworld. But as we have seen with WannaCry, Shadow Brokers, \\nand WikiLeaks Vault 7 and Year Zero, governments that \\nstockpile exploitable vulnerabilities create the potential for \\nleaks. That, in turn, creates a tremendous opportunity for \\nnation-state actors and cybercriminals alike.

They \\nunderstand that cloud systems are mission-critical for many \\norganizations now. They also recognize that they can infiltrate \\nconnected systems faster by breaching cloud systems.\\nSince the end of 2016, Cisco has observed an increase in \\nhacker activity targeting cloud systems, with attacks ranging \\nin sophistication. \\nIn January 2017, our researchers caught hackers hunting for \\nvalid breached corporate identities. Using brute-force attacks, \\nthe hackers were creating a library of verified corporate user \\ncredentials (usernames and passwords), potentially using \\nknown lists of compromised accounts on the web. They were \\nattempting to log in to multiple corporate cloud deployments \\nusing servers on 20 highly suspicious IPs.\\nUsing behavioral analytics and other tools, our researchers \\nanalyzed thousands of customers’ corporate cloud \\nenvironments from December 2016 through mid-February \\n2017. We identified similar patterns of suspicious login \\nattempt activity targeting more than 17 percent of the \\norganizations in our study. The hackers had been randomly \\nrecycling through the 20 IPs to evade detection.\\nWe alerted customers to the issue and blacklisted the \\nsuspicious IPs. What the hackers wanted to use the library \\nof verified corporate user credentials for is not known. \\nPreparation for the launch of a spear-phishing or social \\nengineering campaign is one potential scenario. The malicious \\nactors may also have wanted to sell the working username \\nand password combinations, or use the credential themselves \\nto log in to users’ accounts to try to exfiltrate sensitive data or \\ncompromise other collaborators.

However, security teams face another \\nchallenge that affects all security decisions: The lack of in-\\nhouse security expertise. As threats continue to evolve and \\ntechnology choices proliferate, organizations should increase \\ntheir reliance on security services to fill talent gaps.\\nThe struggle to find and retain qualified talent still impacts \\nsecurity teams; the Security Capabilities Benchmark Study \\nfound that in many industries, a shortage of trained personnel \\nis considered a major obstacle in adopting advanced security \\nprocesses and technology. Indeed, the shortage of talent is a \\nglobal problem. Here again, outside services can bridge the \\ntalent gap.\\nAccording to Cisco security services experts, knowledge \\nof the security landscape is often the missing element in a \\ndefensive framework. The expertise of long-term security \\nprofessionals provides an analysis that products can’t always \\noffer—even the best automated solutions.\\n“Alert fatigue” is an ongoing problem for in-house security \\nteams. As discussed in many of the vertical-focused articles in \\nthe 2017 Security Capabilities Benchmark Study, many security \\npersonnel see far more daily alerts than they can investigate, \\nleaving potentially serious threats unremediated. When many \\nlow-level alerts are generated, they can be automated, \\nan opportunity that many organizations are failing to take advantage of—perhaps simply because of a resource deficiency \\nor an absence of skill. By automating as many of the low-level \\nalerts as possible, organizations can concentrate on higher-\\npriority concerns that are more likely to have a greater impact \\nto the rest of the organization’s environment.\\nThe causes of alert fatigue are several. Siloed systems may \\ncreate duplicate alerts, or teams may not have the knowledge \\nto distinguish between low- and high-priority alerts, or \\nfalse positives. They may lack tools such as auditing that \\ncan determine the source of potential threats. This is where \\nout-of-the-box thinking from outside services teams can cut \\nthrough the “fatigue” and offer nuanced counsel on threats \\nthat need response.\\nA lack of product knowledge can also thwart security teams’ \\nefforts to get the most value from their technology purchases. \\nProducts are often implemented by product specialists, not \\nsecurity specialists. Security teams may not understand how \\nto integrate products to provide a holistic view on threats—the \\n“single pane of glass” that is desirable for a true picture of \\nsecurity effectiveness. Experienced managed-security teams \\ncan also assist security professionals in managing cloud \\nsolutions and understanding how their data is protected (or \\nnot). Cloud providers may not be using security protections \\nsuch as two-factor authentication; experts can help \\norganizations study SLAs and contracts to determine the \\ndefenses that cloud providers are using.'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/Cisco_2017_Midyear_Cybersecurity_Report.pdf', 'page': 63}, page_content='64Cisco 2017 Midyear Cybersecurity Report\\nSecurity Challenges and Opportunities for Defenders\\nOutsourcing service and threat alert data by country\\nIn examining the use of outsourced services by country, \\nSMBs in certain countries show a greater likelihood of using \\noutsourced services than their enterprise counterparts.

Cisco \\nviews the IoT as being made up of three main contexts: \\nInformation technology (IT), operational technology (OT), \\nand consumer technology (CT).\\nThe Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), meanwhile, refers \\nspecifically to connected devices within an industrial control \\nnetwork, as opposed to a corporate IT network or data center.\\nThe IoT holds great promise for business collaboration and \\ninnovation. But as it grows, so too does the security risk it \\npresents to organizations and users.\\nLack of visibility is one problem. Most defenders are not \\naware of what IoT devices are connected to their network. \\nIoT devices, which include everything from cameras to \\nthermostats to smart meters, are generally not built with \\nsecurity in mind. Many of these devices lag well behind \\ndesktop security capabilities and have vulnerability issues that \\ncan take months or years to resolve. In addition, they typically:\\n •Have little or no CVE reporting or updating\\n •Run on specialized architectures\\n •Have unpatched or outdated applications that are \\nvulnerable, like Windows XP\\n •Are rarely patched\\nAlso, IoT devices cannot be accessed easily or at all by their \\ndirect owners, making it difficult to impossible to remediate \\nwhen systems have been compromised. In short, these \\ndevices can serve as strongholds for adversaries (see \\n“Ransomed medical devices: It’s happening,” on page 42 ,  \\nfor examples of this situation).Compounding the security problems with IoT devices is the \\nfact that defenders may have difficulty understanding the \\nnature of the alerts coming from these devices. In addition, it \\nis not always clear who inside the organization is responsible \\nfor addressing IoT compromises. Teams responsible for \\nimplementing these technologies typically leave, or are let go \\nby, the organization following completion of the project.\\nDefenders need to start focusing on potential IoT weaknesses \\nbecause adversaries want to target them to launch ransomware \\ncampaigns, steal sensitive information, and move laterally \\nacross networks. IoT devices are the type of vulnerable “low-\\nhanging fruit” that threat actors are quick to exploit.\\nIn the big picture, a massive compromise of these devices \\nhas the potential to severely disrupt businesses and \\ngovernments—and the Internet itself. DDoS attacks involving \\nIoT devices have already occurred, and the rise of IoT \\nbotnets (see page 39 ) suggests threat actors are already \\nworking to lay the groundwork for destructive campaigns of \\nunprecedented magnitude.\\nTo meet the security challenges of the IoT—an attack surface \\nthat is both growing rapidly and becoming increasingly difficult \\nto monitor and manage—defenders will need to:\\n •Keep older signatures active\\n •Surround IoT devices with IPS defenses\\n •Closely monitor network traffic (this is especially \\nimportant to do in IIoT environments, where network \\ntraffic patterns are very predictable)\\n •Track how IoT devices are touching the network and \\ninteracting with other devices (for example, if an IoT \\ndevice is scanning another device, that is likely a red flag \\nsignaling malicious activity)\\n •Implement patches in a timely manner\\n •Work with vendors that have a product security baseline \\nand issue security advisories\\nIn an IoT world, a proactive and dynamic approach to security, \\nand a layered defense strategy, are the keys to protecting IoT \\ndevices from infection and attack—or at least, mitigating the \\nimpact when some are inevitably compromised by adversaries.'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/Cisco_2017_Midyear_Cybersecurity_Report.pdf', 'page': 65}, page_content='66Cisco 2017 Midyear Cybersecurity Report\\nSecurity Challenges and Opportunities for DefendersSecurity Capabilities Benchmark Study: Focus on select verticals\\nService providers\\nKey industry concerns\\nThe service provider market, as surveyed by Cisco, is a diverse \\nindustry, including businesses such as telecommunications, \\ncloud- and web-scale infrastructure and hosting, media \\ncompanies, and applications provided under the software-\\nas-a-service (SaaS) model.

Limited budgets, a struggle to attract talent, and lack \\nof visibility into threats all affect the public sector’s ability to \\ndefend networks against attackers.\\nHowever, the public sector is also beholden to regulations that \\nrequire close attention to cyber-risk management—more so than \\nmost of the private sector. For example, in the United States, \\nfederal agencies must comply with the Federal Information \\nSecurity Management Act (FISMA) to protect the confidentiality \\nand integrity of mission-critical information systems. There are \\nsimilar requirements on the state and local levels: A bewildering \\narray of new and old regulations cover state and local utility \\norganizations depending on the services delivered.\\nPublic sector organizations are also struggling to manage \\nthe transition to the cloud, a process that is also affected \\nby regulations. At the federal level, the Federal Risk and \\nAuthorization Management Program (FedRAMP) provides \\nstandards for the use of cloud products and services; state \\nand local governments also require certification for cloud \\nproviders housing government data.\\nManaging data in the cloud\\nThe transition to the cloud presents many advantages as \\nwell as challenges to public sector organizations that need to \\nmaintain consistent protection against threats. One-third of \\npublic sector organizations said that targeted attacks, APTs, \\nand insider exfiltration are high security risks. In addition, public \\nsector security professionals said that public cloud storage \\nand cloud infrastructure are the most challenging elements to \\ndefend against attacks.The issue, say Cisco public sector security experts, is that \\ncloud storage offers a different set of tools to protect data, \\nforcing security teams to rethink how they will configure \\ntools and processes to keep data safe. For example, the \\nfeatures in the NetFlow analysis tool don’t map precisely to \\nanalysis tools in cloud services, so processes and outcomes \\nwon’t be the same.\\nBudget, talent shortages affect threat analysis\\nBudget, talent, and regulatory constraints may also be getting in \\nthe way of security goals within the public sector. For example, \\norganizations may be slow in adopting certain tools because \\nthey require knowledgeable staff to implement them, and to \\nanalyze results. Only 30 percent of the public sector security \\nprofessionals said their organizations use penetration testing \\nand endpoint or network forensics tools (see Figure 62). These \\ntools are considered key pillars of a defense-in-depth security \\nstrategy, so their lack of adoption is worrisome.

Of those threats investigated, 32 percent are \\nidentified as legitimate threats, but only 47 percent of those \\nlegitimate threats are eventually remediated.\\nThe number of threats that go uninvestigated is evidence of \\nthe need for tools that share information about alerts and \\nprovide analysis. Such tools add texture and understanding \\nto alerts (making them more valuable), so that staff can \\ndetermine which ones need immediate attention. In addition, \\nautomation can help resolve some threats, reducing the \\nburden on security teams.\\nTo truly examine a large number of daily alerts, Cisco \\nsecurity experts say, a public sector organization might \\nneed dozens of security staffers—yet they rarely have \\nthe headcount. Thirty-five percent of the public sector \\norganizations said they have fewer than 30 employees \\ndedicated to security. In addition, 27 percent said they \\nbelieve a lack of trained personnel is a major obstacle to \\nadopting advanced security processes and technology. This \\nis another reason why automation tools can be essential to \\nbuilding a security defense system to process the amount of \\nthreat alerts generated daily.\\nBreaches drive security improvements\\nThe shortage of people and tested security tools in the public \\nsector has an impact on breaches. Fifty-three percent of the \\npublic sector organizations said they have dealt with public \\nscrutiny due to data breaches. It should be assumed that \\nbreaches will happen, not that organizations might get lucky \\nand be spared an attack. A related problem is that security \\ndirection is driven by the response to attacks—not by a holistic \\napproach to risk-based security. So much effort is needed to \\nrespond to incoming threats that there are no resources left \\nfor long-term planning.\\nPublic sector organizations do indicate that when breaches \\nhappen, security teams learn from the experience: 46 percent \\nsaid breaches drove security improvements to a great extent. \\nHowever, organizations need to invest in technology that gets \\nthem out in front of security breaches, so they can better \\nminimize risk and more effectively manage security systems.Outsourcing adds value, but doesn’t increase  \\nin-house expertise\\nOutsourcing is a key strategy for public sector organizations \\nlooking to gain more resources. Over 40 percent said they \\nfully or partially outsource services such as monitoring and \\naudits. Of those organizations that outsource security services, \\nroughly half cite unbiased insight, cost efficiency, and timely \\nincident response as the top reasons to do so (see Figure 62). \\nPenetration and other audit services should be done by an \\noutside organization, but there is a downside to full reliance \\non outsourced services: It means that public services \\norganizations do not build in-house expertise over time. This \\nin-house knowledge is critical in defending networks against \\nsophisticated attacks. Automated solutions can be cost-\\neffective and timely, but should strike a balance between \\noutsourcing and on-sight experts in order to gain essential \\ninsights and analysis.\\nFigure 63  Outsourcing adds much-needed services\\nSource: Cisco 2017 Security Capabilities Benchmark Study40%\\n8nELDVHG\\x03,nVLJKW\\x0f\\x03&oVW\\x03(˽FLHnF\\\\\\x0f\\nDnG\\x037LPHO\\\\\\x03,nFLGHnW\\x035HVSonVH50%2XWVoXUFH\\x03\\n6HUYLFHVFigure 63  Outsourcing adds much-needed services\\nDownload the 2017 graphics at: cisco.com/go/mcr2017graphics'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/Cisco_2017_Midyear_Cybersecurity_Report.pdf', 'page': 69}, page_content='70Cisco 2017 Midyear Cybersecurity Report\\nSecurity Challenges and Opportunities for DefendersRetail\\nKey industry concerns\\nWhen security breaches hit the retail industry, the news quickly \\nbecomes high-profile. Since attacks on retailers often involve \\nthe exposure of customer financial data or other personal \\ninformation, they receive media attention and require outreach \\nto consumers. Attacks and data breaches in retail affect brand \\nreputation in a much more concrete fashion than in other \\nindustries like healthcare or utilities. Customers have many \\nchoices among retail providers, and if they perceive that a retailer \\nis careless about security, they can easily switch to others.\\nHigh-profile attacks on major retailers, such as those in which \\nmalware is used to steal customer credit card data, worry \\nsecurity professionals who don’t want their organization to \\nsuffer the same fate. However, it’s not clear that enough \\nretailers have taken the message to heart. Retail leaders may \\nbelieve that if they simply protect credit card data within their \\nown firewalls, they’re keeping information secure. But if they’re \\ntransmitting that data unencrypted to banks and other partners, \\nthen protection within retailer networks doesn’t matter much.\\nPerceptions of safety might be signs of overconfidence\\nRetailers have a somewhat rosy view of their security \\nprotections—a view that may not jibe with the number of \\nbreaches covered in the media on an almost daily basis. \\nFor example, 61 percent of the retail security professionals \\nstrongly agree they maintain full PCI compliance, and 63 \\npercent strongly agree that confidential customer data stays \\nsecure throughout its lifecycle in the organization.\\nTo focus on protecting data, retail organizations should fully \\nadopt chip-and-PIN technology for customers paying with \\ncredit and debit cards—especially in the United States, where \\nadoption has been slow.

These OT \\nsystems, which monitor and control physical processes, are \\nbeing targeted because of their known cybersecurity weakness \\nand the physical damage that can be caused by compromises.\\nIn June 2017, researchers discovered that this attack used \\ntools with a new level of sophistication. The attackers used \\nspecialized modules that utilized the control protocols directly. \\nIn prior attacks, remote manipulation of control tools was \\ndone manually. With these new extensions, attacks could be \\nscheduled and run autonomously.\\nThe pervasive connectivity and complexity of modern IT and OT \\nsystems, combined with security weaknesses in deployed OT \\nfirmware and software, increases the attack surface that needs \\nto be protected. As utilities look to digitize their businesses, \\nthey are increasingly adopting newer software technologies that \\nsense, monitor, and actuate physical processes without human \\nintervention. This cyber-physical convergence—the integration \\nof software and embedded systems into physical devices—is \\nincreasing the challenges faced by security professionals.\\nSecurity concerns around cyber-physical convergence \\nextend to the supply chain. The Federal Energy Regulatory \\nCommission (FERC) recently directed the North American \\nEnergy Reliability Corporation (NERC) to develop new standards \\nfor critical infrastructure protection, specifically directed at the \\nutility supply chain. The standards are expected to address \\nsupply chain risk management for industrial control system \\nhardware, software, and computing and networking services \\nassociated with bulk electric system operations.52\\nTargeted attacks and APTs are key concern\\nTargeted attacks are high on the list of worries for utility and \\nenergy security professionals.

Leaders of healthcare \\norganizations fear the attacks that could take down mission-\\ncritical equipment, endangering patients’ lives. They’re also \\nconcerned that security measures designed to monitor online \\ntraffic and detect threats can slow down the flow of data in \\ncritical systems, undermining medical professionals’ ability to \\ndiagnose and treat patients. Beyond critical care, healthcare \\norganizations also recognize that they must focus security \\nsystems on protecting private patient data—for example, \\nas required in the United States by the Health Insurance \\nPortability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\\nAs healthcare organizations bring more connectivity to \\ntheir facilities and devices, security leaders are also raising \\nconcerns about the safety of converged networks. In the \\npast, complex medical devices—such as the Picture Archiving \\nCollection System (PACS), infusion pumps, and patient \\nmonitoring devices—typically arrived with data networks \\nmanaged by vendors, so the devices were physically isolated \\nfrom other networks. Today, with ample bandwidth available, \\nhealthcare organizations believe it’s practical to simply flow \\ndata through one network, and use logical segmentation to \\nseparate various network traffic types such as clinical devices \\nand administrative and guest wireless networks. However, if \\nthis segmentation is not done properly, the risks of attackers \\ngaining access to critical data or devices increases.\\nTargeted attacks concern healthcare security teams\\nRansomware attacks have already done damage to healthcare \\norganizations. They’re an attractive target for online criminals, \\nsince criminals know healthcare providers need to protect \\npatient safety at all costs. In the Cisco study, 37 percent of \\nthe healthcare organizations said that targeted attacks are \\nhigh-security risks to their organizations (see Figure 70). \\nTargeted cyber attacks have also become more worrisome \\nthan breaches involving lost or stolen hardware, demanding a \\nmore precise approach to detecting and mitigating threats.Figure 70  Targeted attacks are high security risk\\nSource: Cisco 2017 Security Capabilities Benchmark Study37%\\nof healthcare \\norganizations said that \\ntargeted attacks are \\nhigh security risks to \\ntheir organizationsHealthcareFigure 70  Targeted attacks are high security risk\\nUnfortunately, as is true in many industries, there are more \\nthreats than there are time and staff to investigate.

Examples are the \\nDridex credential-stealing malware53 and the Zeus Trojan.54\\nIn this environment, financial service security professionals \\nrecognize that their threat defenses should be effective \\nagainst attackers using sophisticated malware. However, \\nthey also know they are hampered by a complicated mix of \\nsecurity vendors and products, which obfuscates threats \\ninstead of providing insight. Security teams also face the \\ndaunting task of integrating legacy applications with emerging \\ntechnologies, while ensuring that no security gaps occur.\\nAs some financial services organizations partner with \\nfintech (financial technology) firms, they find the attack \\nsurface potentially expands and becomes more complex. \\nHow can these partnerships provide adequate protection \\nof customer data? How do financial services organizations \\npartner with outside firms while also meeting strict regulatory \\nrequirements? These questions factor into how the industry \\nwill approach its security challenges in the coming years.\\nFinancial services organizations must also ensure they are \\n“compliant” as well as “secure.” In various heavily regulated \\nindustries, there’s a tendency to believe that meeting \\ncompliance requirements will resolve security issues. \\nCompliance requirements, such as network segmentation, \\ncertainly help protect data, but they are only part of the solution \\nfor stopping security breaches and providing threat analysis.\\nMultivendor environment adds confusion, not clarity\\nIt’s common for financial services organizations to have a \\nmultivendor environment. Fifty-seven percent of the financial \\nservices organizations said they use solutions from at least \\nsix vendors, while 29 percent use more than 10 vendors (see \\nFigure 74). Two-thirds of the financial services organizations \\nsaid they use at least six security products; 33 percent use \\nmore than 10 products. \\n53 “Dridex Attacks Target Corporate Accounting,” by Martin Nystrom, Cisco Security blog, March 4, 2015: blogs.cisco.com/security/dridex-attacks-target-corporate-accounting .\\n54 “Zeus Trojan Analysis,” by Alex Kirk, Cisco Talos Blog: talosintelligence.com/zeus_trojan .Figure 74  Percentage of financial services organizations \\nthat use solutions from 6 or more vendors\\nSource: Cisco 2017 Security Capabilities Benchmark Study29%\\n57%Financial\\nServices\\nOrganizations6+\\n10+ VendorsFigure 7\\x17  3erFentaJe of ̀nanFial serviFes \\norganizations that use solutions from \\n\\x19 or Pore venGors\\nCisco security experts say that in this industry, it would \\nbe common to see products from as many as 30 vendors \\nat a single organization.

The primary goal of every one of \\nthese reports is to keep security teams and the businesses \\nthey support apprised of known and emerging threats and \\nvulnerabilities—and informed about the steps they can take to \\nmake their organizations more secure and cyber resilient.\\nThe diversity of content that our threat researchers and \\ntechnology partners have presented in this latest report \\nreflects the complexity of the modern threat landscape. Much \\nof the research also shows that defenders not only have been \\ngaining ground on adversaries, but also developing a much \\nbetter understanding of how and where threat actors operate.\\nHowever, we expect that defenders will struggle to maintain \\nground as the IoT expands. As discussed in the introduction \\nto this report, there are signs that new types of attacks—more \\nsinister and destructive than campaigns of the past—are in \\ndevelopment. Adversaries are devising high-impact, well-\\nplanned attacks that are designed to prevent any organization, \\nbig or small, from operating. They know that no business \\nhas a contingency plan that outlines how to rebuild all their \\nIT or OT from scratch, and they are determined to use that \\nweakness to their advantage.That is why it has never been more important for organizations \\nto make cybersecurity a top priority. They must invest in \\nautomated tools that can help security teams stay on top of \\nalerts, gain visibility into and manage their dynamic networks, \\nand detect and respond swiftly to true threats. And they must \\ndevote the time and resources to ensure they always know \\nexactly what is in their IT environment, and that everything \\nwithin it is deployed correctly and securely and kept up to date.\\nThe security community, meanwhile, needs to expand its \\nthinking and dialogue about how to create an open ecosystem \\nthat will allow customers to implement security solutions that \\nwill work best for their organization and make the most of \\nexisting investments. In this ecosystem, all security solutions \\ncan communicate with each other, and work together to \\nprotect users and businesses. A unified effort from defenders \\nis needed to meet the challenge of potent threats meant to \\ndisrupt the IoT world and inflict devastating impact on the \\norganizations operating within it.'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/Cisco_2017_Midyear_Cybersecurity_Report.pdf', 'page': 83}, page_content='84Cisco 2017 Midyear Cybersecurity Report\\nConclusion\\nSecurity leaders: It’s time to claim a seat at the top table\\n55 Data, information and content sourced directly from, and with permission from, the National Association of Corporate Directors’ 2016-2017 Public Company Governance Survey.  \\nThe survey is available for download from the NACD at nacdonline.org/Resources/publicsurvey.cfm?ItemNumber=36843 .\\n56 Society for Information Management IT Trends Study, Kappelman, L.

Also, security professionals believe \\nthat executive teams keep security high on the list of key \\norganizational goals. However, the number of security \\nprofessionals who strongly agreed that their executive \\nleadership considers security a high priority was 59 \\npercent in 2016—down slightly from 61 percent in 2015 \\nand 63 percent in 2014.\\nThat decline in confidence may be misplaced, however. \\nChief information security officers (CISOs), in particular, \\nmay not realize that senior management and boards of \\ndirectors not only view cybersecurity as a high priority \\nfor the business, but also are eager to hear more about \\nthe issue. In fact, they are likely looking for better and \\nmore information.\\nAccording to the National Association of Corporate \\nDirectors’ (NACD) 2016–2017 Public Company \\nGovernance Survey,55 almost one-quarter of boards are \\ndissatisfied with the reporting that management delivers \\non cybersecurity. They report that the information they \\nreceive does not allow for effective benchmarking, \\nis not transparent about problems, and is difficult to \\ninterpret. In the same report, only 14 percent of the \\nrespondents felt that their board has a high level of \\nunderstanding about cyber risks.\\nSecurity experts with SAINT Corporation, a security \\nsolutions company and Cisco partner, suggest that \\nCISOs have a clear opportunity to help fill that knowledge \\ngap. However, they must:\\n •Strive to provide information in a way that will be \\nmeaningful and actionable for the business. Reports \\nabout the organization’s cyber risks or security \\nneeds should not be overly technical. Try to align the \\ndiscussion about these issues with traditional risks \\nthat the company faces, and tie them to business \\npriorities and desired outcomes.  Also, be sure to emphasize how cybersecurity can \\nbe a growth enabler and competitive differentiator for \\nthe business.\\n •When alerting management and the board to a cyber \\nattack, explain in clear terms what the impact is to the \\norganization (for example, how many employees or \\ncustomers are affected, what high-value information \\nhas been compromised), what measures the security \\nteam is taking to contain and investigate the threat, \\nand how long it will take to resume normal operations.\\n •Seek to engage other leaders in the organization, \\nincluding those outside of the technology department. \\nBy collaborating regularly with a range of leaders in \\nthe organization—the chief information officer, chief \\ntechnology officer, chief audit executive, and the chief \\nrisk officer, to name a few—CISOs can gain a direct \\nline to senior management and the board. This will \\nalso provide a better opportunity to secure a seat at \\nthe “top table” to discuss cybersecurity strategy and \\nhelp develop a comprehensive security program for \\nthe organization.\\nCISOs often struggle to secure funding for security \\ninitiatives. But here again, they may not realize that \\nnow may be the ideal time to discuss budgets with \\nleadership. The 2017 IT Trends Study from the \\nSociety for Information Management (SIM) reports that \\ncybersecurity is the third largest area of investment \\nfor organizations today.56 In 2013, it ranked 14th. \\nRespondents to the SIM survey (IT leaders) also \\nranked cybersecurity second among areas of IT that \\nshould receive more investment, and first on the \\nlist of information technologies that they find “most \\npersonally worrisome.”57'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/Cisco_2017_Midyear_Cybersecurity_Report.pdf', 'page': 84}, page_content='About Cisco'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/2024-unit42-incident-response-report.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content='7Incident Response Report 2024\\nWho’s Doing It?\\nIn 2023, by far the most damaging threat actor was a group we call \\nMuddled Libra. They’re a criminal group focused on /uniFB01nancial gain. They are also one of the most aggressive threat actors in the landscape today. Countering their attacks is a challenge for defenders of small and large organizations alike. This report has a special section on them, including an analysis of what they do and how you can defend against them. \\nOf course, they weren’t the only group in the mix. We also responded to \\ncompromises from other criminal groups, state-aligned actors, and some groups that we don’t know enough about yet to characterize.\\nAnswering this question of “who” is one of the things that Unit 42 Threat \\nIntelligence is great at. We’ll keep researching and uncovering attackers wherever they try to hide. \\nHow Do Threat Actors Get In?\\nIn the past year, attackers’ initial access most often started with a software vulnerability. The largest attack campaigns began with successful exploitation of internet-facing systems. From there, the stories varied. \\nNaturally, we also saw other techniques, from attackers using previously \\nstolen credentials, phishing (both in email and chat), and more. \\nBut don’t be misled–though phishing lost the top spot and dropped to \\nnumber three, it’s still a serious threat. Attackers leverage phishing attacks for access, credentials, and tokens, rather than trying to drop malware. \\nWhat Helped Threat Actors Succeed?\\nThere were three security weaknesses that weren’t themselves the cause of incidents, but made attackers’ lives easier. Address these, and you’ll be helping yourself and hurting them.\\n• Patch management. It’s only a matter of time. Unpatched \\nvulnerabilities on internet-facing systems will be exploited. Measure and \\nreduce your attack surface, and you’ll improve this.\\n• Consistent coverage. Our incident responders found that \\norganizations with partial or incomplete deployment of security controls (especially endpoint detection and response tools) allowed attackers to operate from parts of the network that weren’t defended. Deploy your defenses everywhere, and you’ll deny them this advantage.\\n• Identity and access management. More attackers are stealing and \\nusing the identity of authorized personnel to access and move around networks. Make that harder and embark on or continue a journey toward Zero Trust networking, and you’ll pressure attackers into making mistakes you can see.Actors, Methods and Targets\\nSubscribe NowListen to Unit 42’s\\nWhere we share unique \\nthreat intelligence insights, \\nnew threat actor TTPs,\\nand real-world case studies.'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/2024-unit42-incident-response-report.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='8Incident Response Report 2024 Actors, Methods and Targets\\nWho’s Being Targeted?\\nThe top six industries in our casework stayed the same this year, and they accounted for \\n63% of our cases: \\n     1.

We don’t believe they are state-sponsored, but they are as aggressive and as skilled at attack operations as some advanced, persistent threat (APT) groups.\\nThe group includes people with strong English language skills, \\nwhich they use in written and spoken communications.

These incidents appeared to be supply-chain attacks, in which the threat actor tried to compromise organizations and systems that would give them access to cryptocurrency assets.\\nFor example, many online systems use SMS as a second factor of authentication. By compromising \\na telecom provider, Muddled Libra gained access to SIM-swap or port-out telephone numbers. Together with compromised /uniFB01rst-factor credentials, the threat actor could steal cryptocurrency from a target and leave little recourse.\\nIn the latter half of 2023, along with joining the BlackCat/AlphV ransomware group as an aﬃliate, \\nMuddled Libra shifted or added to its targeting to include larger organizations that are particularly sensitive to service interruptions. Incidents at several large hospitality providers were publicly reported, but that was not nearly all the activity.\\nAs a ransomware-as-a-service aﬃliate, Muddled Libra enjoys access to a much larger pool of \\ntargets and a simpli/uniFB01ed attack chain.\\nHow Do They Get In?\\nMuddled Libra uses several methods to gain access to an environment such as: \\n     Social engineering both IT help desk and end users\\n     Buying access from a broker     Stealing credentials from user endpoints\\nReusing compromised infrastructure or re-exploiting un/uniFB01xed vulnerabilities used \\nby a previous attacker\\nPerhaps the highest-impact access method is scamming the target’s IT help desk. A threat actor \\nwill call the target’s IT help desk and impersonate a valid user. They will ask for help with resetting the user’s password and/or changing the mobile phone number associated with the account. Often, the request comes with a “sob story” or other emotion intended to manipulate the help desk worker. This attack only takes a few minutes.\\nMuddled Libra is unusually comfortable with engaging over the telephone, with both help desk \\nand other employees. They are more successful in persuading people to engage in unsafe actions as a result.\\nOften, they will acquire initial access by taking over a less-privileged legitimate user account. Then, \\nthey identify the more highly privileged accounts that will help them achieve their objectives and call back to take over those accounts. \\nIn one case that Unit 42 worked, the attackers successfully hoodwinked the help desk three \\nseparate times.\\nMuddled Libra also buys stolen credentials from initial access brokers. The threat group has been very \\nopen about their desire to buy access to certain targets, especially in the segments they have chosen.

They appear to focus on stealing session tokens and saved credentials. They have also been seen misusing legitimate forensics tools to search for credentials in live memory. This can be a vector if organizational credentials are stored in unmanaged systems.\\nAnd of course, given Muddled Libra’s history with \\nsupply chain compromise, it should be no surprise that they can bypass SMS-based multifactor authentication (MFA). Their main tactic is SIM swapping, moving the second factor to a device under their control. They also perform “MFA fatigue attacks,” a tactic to defeat push-based second factors. \\nIn this tactic, the attacker uses compromised \\ncredentials to satisfy the /uniFB01rst factor and then repeatedly solicits a second-factor push from the authorized account holder. Eventually, after many push noti/uniFB01cations, or from a lack of caution, the authorized account holder will approve the second factor push.Why Is It So Hard to Eject This \\nThreat Actor?\\nIn short, Muddled Libra is often as skilled and \\nfamiliar with a target’s IT infrastructure as the people who manage it. And they are not constrained by change control, compliance, or corporate policy.\\nKnowledge\\nMuddled Libra has advanced skills and \\nunderstanding of modern IT operations, compared to other threat actors.\\nUnlike other threat actors who typically only \\nperform light (if any) reconnaissance on their target, Muddled Libra performs extensive research both before and during the compromise.\\nThey have been observed accessing a target’s \\nown technical documentation, reading incident response standard operating procedures and playbooks, how-to documentation, and otherwise furthering their understanding of the target’s environment. Then they use this knowledge to understand where to place implants and what defenders are likely to do in response.\\nVariety and Having a Plan B, C, D...\\nMuddled Libra creates multiple backdoors \\ninto environments, installing rootkits, remote management tools, and outbound tunnels that they can use for later access even if their primary access is discovered and removed. We have seen them install a half dozen or more of these utilities.\\nThey create new accounts for themselves whose \\nnames mimic existing privileged accounts. Sometimes they reactivate existing but previously disabled accounts and use those. This tactic avoids a “new account creation” alert. \\nRather than attack from obvious locations \\nsuch as commercial hosting and server farms, Muddled Libra has moved to using residential proxy services such as NSOCKS and Truesocks. This makes it so that their connections appear to originate from the correct geographic location and from a plausible network provider.\\nIf social engineering access methods \\ndon’t work, Muddled Libra also has technical tactics to use as well.'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/2024-unit42-incident-response-report.pdf', 'page': 11}, page_content='12Incident Response Report 2024\\n12\\nSpotlight On: Muddled Libra\\nIT, Virtualization, and Cloud Skills\\nMuddled Libra even attempts to access and use \\nexisting endpoint and systems management tool–such as endpoint detection and response (EDR/XDR) consoles, patch management, and the like–for reconnaissance, data theft and malware deployment.. And naturally, they use credential-stealing tools such as Mimikatz to help them move laterally and escalate privileges.\\nThis threat group is also adept at using current \\nIT and cloud management tools. They’ll use the remote-management tools that are legitimately present in a target environment and also add their own. They’ll search GitHub for code and keys, and they’ll steal both.\\nCloud infrastructure is just as much at risk as \\nclassic IT infrastructure. Muddled Libra can use miscon/uniFB01gured cloud environments from Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure, creating service accounts and additional access keys even in the very early stages of an attack. Some organizations have thought they evicted the threat actor from their premises, only to have them come back through access from the cloud.\\nVirtualized environments are also at risk. If a client \\ndoes not contain a compromised virtual system quickly enough, this threat actor can reverse the containment, take over the host or hypervisor and lock the target out of their own infrastructure.And even classic on-premises infrastructure can be attacked using remote infrastructure management tools (many of which have attracted patches in the last few years) at the system and the hardware level. \\nThey are also familiar with secure email \\ngateways and email storage systems. They’ll change rules to redirect or intercept noti/uniFB01cations and recovery-related email to avert detection and response. In some cases they have created rules to redirect messages from speci/uniFB01c security vendors to the threat actors. This tactic allows them to monitor the investigation as it proceeds.\\nEx/uniFB01ltration\\nMuddled Libra has ex/uniFB01ltrated data to \\ncommercial /uniFB01le-hosting services. They have also staged their tools in these services. Network traﬃc monitoring often doesn’t alert on known /uniFB01le-hosting services.\\nThey also create and use external virtual private \\nnetwork (VPN) services to create outbound tunnels for ex/uniFB01ltration, obscuring their traﬃc from inspection devices. \\n'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/2024-unit42-incident-response-report.pdf', 'page': 12}, page_content='13Incident Response Report 2024\\n13\\nSpotlight On: Muddled Libra\\nTips for Defenders\\nDefending against Muddled Libra requires \\nsustained eﬀort before, during, and after a compromise. Focus your energy on detecting their tactics rather than their tools. Tools can change rapidly, but tactics take longer.\\nProtect Credentials\\nTraining end-users not to approve MFA requests \\nthey didn’t solicit is important. You can further reduce the human-error burden by requiring number matching as well. \\nSudden high volumes of MFA requests are a \\nbright red, waving /uniFB02ag, especially if they go unacknowledged or are aimed at high-privileged accounts. Have a tool and process to rapidly identify and investigate this activity. Give the analyst performing the investigation the information to go out of band quickly. \\nWatch for velocity changes in MFA enrollment. \\nMost people don’t lose their phones often. Put additional scrutiny on changes to high-privileged accounts. Consider a policy that requires live visual and audible veri/uniFB01cation with a third party, such as the requestor’s direct supervisor. These policies do slow down legitimate requests as well. But having a well-known policy requiring veri/uniFB01cation resists attacker attempts to pressure junior personnel into making unauthorized changes.\\nGuard against SIM swapping. Educate users that \\nif their phone suddenly loses service, they should treat that as a potential security problem as well as an availability problem. Require that devices being used for corporate authentication (even personally owned devices) be locked with a PIN against port-out and SIM changes in the mobile carrier’s systems.\\nWatch account creation and reactivation. Alert \\non new account creation that doesn’t quite /uniFB01t naming conventions. Alert and escalate on old or intentionally disabled privileged accounts being reactivated.Monitor Behavior\\nLog and analyze the usage patterns of your key \\nsecurity tools (“Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?”) Personnel accessing an XDR platform outside their usual work hours might just be industrious, or their account might be under a threat actor’s control. Many organizations collect these kinds of audit logs but don’t ever analyze them for outliers. Do so regularly.\\nWatch for changes in your cloud infrastructure. \\nMonitor both your IT infrastructure cloud (such as directory services and cloud storage) as well as service infrastructure, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) and similar environments. Look for changes to logging settings and privileges.\\nCheck your code repositories. Ensure you’re \\nnot inadvertently exposing secrets, of course. But also look for new connections to third-party infrastructure and unusual patterns of access.\\nAnd watch the behavior of your virtual desktop \\nsystems. Check for outlier access patterns (though this attacker’s use of residential proxies will make that more diﬃcult). Look for unusual process trees. (A good endpoint protection tool should catch this itself, but you should still ensure you’re running down investigative leads from time to time rather than just closing everything as a false positive to keep the metrics good.) And try to alert on unusual storage usage, to catch staging for ex/uniFB01ltration. \\nFocus your energy on detecting their \\ntactics rather than their tools. Tools can change rapidly, but tactics take longer.'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/2024-unit42-incident-response-report.pdf', 'page': 13}, page_content='14Incident Response Report 2024 Spotlight On: Muddled Libra\\nKnow Your Applications\\nIf you see red-teaming tools in your environment, make sure there is an \\nauthorized red-team engagement underway. One SOC we worked with had a company logo sticker on the wall for each red team they’d caught. \\nWatch which remote management tools are being used in your \\norganization. If you see new tools you don’t normally use, or diﬀerent versions of the ones you do, dig at that. And try to identify unusual usage of the tools as well. For example, if your remote tools are normally used by IT staﬀ, but suddenly one person in /uniFB01nance is using them, /uniFB01nd out why.\\nEndpoint management and inventory tools can help here, too. Use \\nthem to scan the /uniFB02eet and identify new or low-prevalence tools and executables. Then, train your analysts and models “what good looks like” (and doesn’t).\\nWatch the Network\\nBe suspicious of connections to your network from commercial VPN \\nproviders. While many people use such services, especially on their personal devices, discourage them. Commercial VPN providers add little if any security to a well-defended network, especially one built on Zero Trust principles.\\nHold privileged users to a higher standard. Collect and monitor the \\npatterns of where they access their accounts from and ask about outliers. If you use a corporate messaging platform that indicates a user’s time and location (e.g., “It’s 9:43 a.m. for Alice”), that can be a quick validator for SOC personnel wondering if Alice is really logging in from Aruba. \\nWatch outbound access, too. Monitor for connections that look like \\nencrypted tunnels, particularly from new or unmanaged systems. If you can interdict connections at the network level (with technology and policy) use that capability judiciously.\\nAnd watch for commercial /uniFB01le-hosting providers. If you can restrict \\naccess to just the ones you have organizational agreements with, do that. If not, monitor connections to the ones you’re not intending to use widely and watch for high data counts in short amounts of time. We have seen terabytes of data ex/uniFB01ltrated in a couple of hours.\\nSummarizing the \\nAdversary\\nMuddled Libra is a methodical, evolving adversary that poses a substantial threat to many organizations. They’re pro/uniFB01cient with security tooling and are able to execute rapidly and eﬀectively even in relatively secure environments. They evolve and change tactics constantly. It’s important to stay informed about their latest techniques.\\nDefenders need to combine \\nstrong technology and security practices with diligent monitoring to detect and interdict this group’s activity. Because of their speed, early detection and interruption of the attack chain is even more important. You may have only a couple hours between compromise and ex/uniFB01ltration.\\nThe good news? The threat \\nraised by this adversary creates an opportunity to take a critical look at what an advanced attacker could do in your environment–and prepare improvements to frustrate them. \\nUnit 42 Threat Intelligence \\npublishes and updates assessments of this threat group. And as our security consultants face Muddled Libra during incident response, we collect more information /uniFB01rsthand and /uniFB02ow that threat intelligence throughout the Palo Alto Networks platform.'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/2024-unit42-incident-response-report.pdf', 'page': 14}, page_content='15Initial Compromise\\nEveryone wants to know how the bad guy got in, in the /uniFB01rst \\nplace. We reviewed the data from our casework over the last several years. A few trends emerged: some changed, some stayed the same.\\nThere were certainly a lot of security incidents in 2023, and \\nthere were de/uniFB01nitely some times when it felt like defenders couldn’t get a break from all the exploited vulnerabilities and campaigns that occurred. \\nBut, some key incident metrics improved.'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/2024-unit42-incident-response-report.pdf', 'page': 15}, page_content='16Incident Response Report 2024\\nIncident Discovery\\nThe /uniFB01rst question we ask in a security incident is, how was it discovered? \\nInternal Vs. External Discovery\\nIn /uniFB01gure 1, we show the proportion of Internal, External, and Partner sources of incidents. \\nInternal means the client discovered the incident. External means a party other than the client did. Partner, in our casework, is usually a service provider to the target–something like a managed service, managed security service, or a managed detection and response. \\nFigure 1. Sources of incidents for Unit 42 IR cases in 2023\\nOne data caveat here, though. Sometimes, those partner organizations appear to us to be an internal source, so there may be a little fuzziness on the Partner-Internal line. (For example, sometimes a client says they discovered an incident, but it was actually identi/uniFB01ed by their managed security services provider. For our purposes as responders, those don’t change how we conduct the investigation.)\\nSo what does this incident discovery data mean, overall? We think it’s mostly good news. \\nDiscovering four out of /uniFB01ve incidents internally is pretty good. \\nTogether with the reduction in median dwell time that we (and others) have observed, \\nthis could mean that detection eﬀorts are paying oﬀ. Compromised organizations are \\ndiscovering sooner that they need to address a problem, rather than being surprised by an external party turning up with a folder full of IP addresses and bad news.\\nHowever, we wouldn’t be engineers and consultants if we didn’t ask, “How can this be \\nimproved?” It’s worth thinking about this statistic in the context of your strategic plans. How will you /uniFB01nd incidents in the information available to you? What will you do when you /uniFB01nd it? Can you improve on both answers? What resources do you need to be–as Daft Punk so insightfully suggested–“harder, better, faster, stronger”?Initial Compromise\\n'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/2024-unit42-incident-response-report.pdf', 'page': 16}, page_content='17Incident Response Report 2024\\nCon/uniFB01rmed Security Incidents\\nThe second question in any incident response is similarly meaningful. Is this actually a \\nsecurity incident, or just a false alarm? Figure 2 shows that most of the time, the potential incident is con/uniFB01rmed. \\nIn the /uniFB01gure above,“Con/uniFB01rmed” means what it says; this is genuinely a problem. \\n“Suspected” means we think it was an incident, but we can’t be sure, due to some limitation. Often this was a lack of available logs or a limited scope of investigation. A “False Positive” means the alert that kicked oﬀ the investigation was a true alert, but after investigation no other impact was found. And a “Near Miss” is the lucky ticket where some unauthorized activity occurred, but no asset or information was compromised (e.g., a vulnerability was exploited successfully, but there was no further unauthorized access).\\nCon/uniFB01rmed incidents held relatively steady at around three-quarters of all incidents. The \\nchanges in Suspected (which decreased), Near Miss, and False Positive are heartening. We think it means that more organizations are willing to investigate potential incidents. That’s good for defenders. It indicates growing maturity, willingness to engage help, and improved operational ability. \\nAgain, a caveat: This data is drawn from incidents we worked on, which by de/uniFB01nition \\nmeans someone reached out for help. So there is a set of incidents that we don’t know about and aren’t represented in this data, and it might be a large set.\\nNevertheless, a negative incident /uniFB01nding, con/uniFB01rming a Near Miss or a False Positive–\\nthese all have value, because: \\n• You know what you don’t have to do.\\n• You exercise your processes, /uniFB01nd gaps and keep those incident response \\nmuscles working.Initial Compromise\\nFigure 2.

We’ll give more \\nrecommendations for how to do that later in this report, but for the moment, there are a few key principles to keep in mind: \\n•  Preparation. One of the best ways to get ahead of attackers is to truly get ahead. \\nThrough proactive preparation, organizations can get ready to respond within hours to \\ncompromises, stopping attackers before they have a chance to execute their plans.\\n•  Automation. As we mentioned in the Black Basta example above, human security \\nteams need to sleep, and they’re also typically pulled in many directions. Automation–especially when powered by machine learning and AI–can help defenders sift through alerts and surface the ones that truly need attention. \\n•  Zero Trust. Another powerful way to limit the damage an attacker can do after \\ncompromise is to limit their movement and activity. When organizations design their security posture in accordance with a Zero Trust philosophy, attackers become less powerful when they gain initial access, because initial access means much less. It’s the diﬀerence between a thief getting into an entryway and being able to move through the entire building, and a thief getting into the lobby only to encounter another locked door. \\n•  Defense in depth. A security program designed with overlapping defenses and \\ncontrols gives attackers more opportunity to alert you to their presence. Especially combined with limited privileges in a Zero Trust philosophy, you can raise the signal-to-noise ratio of meaningful alerts that will let you focus on attacker activity earlier in the attack lifecycle.\\n'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/2024-unit42-incident-response-report.pdf', 'page': 18}, page_content='19Incident Response Report 2024\\nThe Beginning of an Investigation\\nAt the beginning of an incident investigation, after the discovery and con/uniFB01rmation are \\nknown, the next question typically asked is, how did this start? \\nInvestigation Types\\nWe divide our case data by type of investigation. \\nThis data is useful to understand the large macro trends, but it shouldn’t be \\nmisinterpreted as the likelihood of getting hit by one or another type of attack. That probability is much more in/uniFB02uenced by who you are, what data you have, and which threat actors are best matched to your threat pro/uniFB01le.\\nFigure 3 shows the top /uniFB01ve investigation types for the last several years.Initial Compromise\\nFigure 3. Top /uniFB01ve investigation types in Unit 42 IR cases from 2021 to 2023\\nThese data points are a little more diﬃcult to interpret. First, let’s clarify the terms.We divide Extortion into two subcategories: with or without encryption. Business email \\ncompromise (BEC) means an investigation centered on unauthorized takeover of email accounts. Network Intrusion is related to unauthorized access to a network environment–accessing a system or database without authorization, for example. And Web App Compromise means unauthorized access to, and/or taking advantage of a vulnerability in, a browser-based application.\\nWhile the top /uniFB01ve investigation types are reasonably static, making sense of them is a \\nlittle tricky. (Other is also in this data series, but since it’s not meaningful in this context, we left it out).\\n'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/2024-unit42-incident-response-report.pdf', 'page': 19}, page_content='20Incident Response Report 2024\\nWe’ll start with a caution. One trend that looks \\nvalid in the data–but might not be in real life–is the apparent decline in extortion with encryption. Those investigations are a decreasing fraction of our casework. However, there are a couple of confounding factors.\\n• The organizations we’re working with are \\nchanging. Over these same three years, \\nwe have been helping more and larger \\norganizations that, generally, have more advanced security maturity. They’re more likely to have deployed endpoint controls, security automation and orchestration, network segmentation, and MFA. So, their resilience against encryption tactics is already higher.\\n• Speed matters. We and our clients may be \\ninterrupting incidents early enough to keep them from becoming ransom cases. Deploying encryption comes relatively late in the attack lifecycle. Our clients seem to be initiating investigations sooner than before. So, if an attacker has succeeded at intrusion but hasn’t yet completed the other prerequisites to encryption, we don’t classify it as an extortion with encryption case.So there may be a dataset bias at work here. The same confounding factors may be at play for BEC.\\nNow, with that said, there are a few things that \\nseem reasonable on their face.\\nThe increase in network intrusions is sensible \\nin light of large campaigns involving software vulnerabilities (including MOVEit, Citrix Bleed, and Microsoft Exchange RCE). Likewise for Web App Compromise, which was the engine behind some truly massive campaigns in 2023, such as the SugarCRM CVE-2023-22952 authentication bypass and remote code execution vulnerability.\\nWe refer to these as large campaigns because \\nthe vulnerability is visible from the internet. Threat actors exploited the vulnerabilities at a large scale by scanning large portions of address space looking for vulnerable systems. In the largest cases, they developed software that automated the scanning as well as the exploitation. Then, some groups automated the data theft. We’ll go into more detail about that later.\\nThe small but present growth of extortion \\nwithout encryption also /uniFB01ts the anecdotal evidence. Some threat actors have found that the threat of publishing non-public data is more powerful than holding it hostage, and they’re capitalizing on that.

Educational institutions have shut down or failed due to ransomware attacks, and attack groups such as Muddled Libra use ransomware-as-a-service software as part of their repertoire. Real-world implications abound such as disruptions in supply chains or hospitals, or taking critical gas pipelines oﬄine. \\nExtortion groups have increasingly sought to gain leverage \\nwherever possible, particularly through multi-extortion tactics. This means that, in addition to encrypting data and holding business operations hostage until a ransom is paid, attackers often pile on additional nasty inducements to push their victims to pay. This may include stealing data and oﬀering it for sale to the highest bidder–often publicly, through dark web leak sites. In other cases, Unit 42 incident responders have encountered groups that harass an organization’s employees or customers. \\nIn our observations of dark web leak sites, we saw a 49% \\nincrease in posting alleged victims when comparing similar periods in 2022 and 2023. There is much more extortion activity than what can be observed through public postings. \\nAnd multi-extortion tactics seem to be eﬀective for attackers. As \\nshown in the tables below, when we consider all cases involving extortion, we see various tactics used at a relatively steady rate from 2021-2023.\\n'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/2024-unit42-incident-response-report.pdf', 'page': 21}, page_content='22Incident Response Report 2024\\n22\\nSpotlight On: Extortion\\nHowever, when we consider cases where payment was made, a diﬀerent pattern emerges. \\nThe use of harassment in those cases has grown from less than 1% to 27% in just two years. Data theft has more than doubled in prevalence, from 40% in 2021 to 82% of cases in 2023. \\nExtortion Tactic 2021 2022 2023\\nEncryption 96% 89.9% 89.2%\\nData Theft 52.8% 59.4% 53.3%\\nHarassment 5.1% 8.6% 8.3%\\nTable 1.

For cases involving extortion where payment was made, we saw a dramatic increase in the use of additional extortion tactics since 2021. This shows the eﬃcacy of those tactics for attackers. \\nIn general, it is best not to pay a ransom demand. Paying enriches criminals, further \\nencourages threat actors to continue attacking organizations, and robs victims of their funds and other resources. \\nWith that said, there are extenuating circumstances where organizations can be left with \\nlittle choice but to pay. In these cases, work with incident response experts to negotiate demands if needed. These experts can also help avoid missteps, and oﬀer advice on technical and other potential challenges. \\nDo attackers keep their promises once they’ve been paid?\\nFigure 4. While in general it is best \\nnot to make payments in response to extortion, in cases where payment was made, we observed that attackers kept their promises more often than not.'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/2024-unit42-incident-response-report.pdf', 'page': 22}, page_content='23Incident Response Report 2024\\n23\\nSpotlight On: Extortion\\nThe Unit 42 team also typically advises that organizations get assistance to engage \\nthe threat actor even when they do not intend to pay, for a variety of reasons. First, stalling through communication can aﬀord you more time to focus on recovery eﬀorts. Second, you can use the extra time to determine whether the threat actor has stolen any sensitive information (including speci/uniFB01cs on what was supposedly taken). Third, during communications with the threat actor, you can sometimes glean critical information that could be helpful for investigative and threat intelligence purposes.\\nThe amount of time that an organization can spend negotiating with a ransomware group \\ndepends on how signi/uniFB01cantly the ransomware aﬀects daily operations. On the one hand, organizations with no viable backups that cannot restore operations without quickly obtaining a decryptor will often pay on a more aggressive timeline. \\nOn the other hand, organizations that have viable backups or that are not in a hurry can \\nnegotiate on a more extended timeline. As a general rule, negotiation conversations can often extend the original deadline set by threat actors. For example, threat actors may originally set a deadline of 72 hours to pay before they follow through on their extortion threat, but these negotiations last up to 11 days in most cases. \\nTypically, with most ransomware threat actors, Unit 42 researchers have observed a \\ncorrelation between the length of negotiations and the percent reduction agreed upon for payment. In other words, the longer an organization can wait before agreeing to pay, the better “deal” they will often get. We’ve seen organizations decide to pay a ransom on the /uniFB01rst day of negotiations, and we’ve seen organizations pay 35 days into the process.\\nWhen organizations decide to pay a ransom, we recommend working with a payment \\nvendor rather than arranging direct payment. These vendors provide a number of helpful services, including due diligence checks related to potential sanctions against certain threat actor groups. Without this type of check, paying a threat actor could introduce additional legal trouble for an organization, on top of the disruption of the ransomware attack. \\nRansom demands are typically payable in some form of cryptocurrency, and the \\nassociated blockchain transactions are publicly visible to an extent. If you use your own cryptocurrency wallet, you might not adequately hide the /uniFB02ow of currency. \\nFigure 5. Decrease in median ransom demand from 2022 to 2023'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/2024-unit42-incident-response-report.pdf', 'page': 23}, page_content='24Incident Response Report 2024\\n24\\nSpotlight On: Extortion\\nFor example, we’ve seen cases where \\norganizations paid directly, allowing the threat actors to garner clues about additional funds present. Sometimes, a threat actor may use this information to demand to be paid even more than was agreed—even up to the remaining balance in the cryptocurrency wallet!\\nA trick like this goes hand in hand with ransomware \\nactors’ moves toward multi-extortion. In general, they’re looking for any way they can /uniFB01nd to make more money or push an organization to pay. \\nThe industry has even recently seen reports \\nof threat actors taking advantage of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosure rules to open a new avenue of extortion. In mid-November, news broke of threat actors reporting their victim to the SEC, and this could be a tactic we see more in the future. By using the threat of SEC enforcement, threat actors could threaten your time–whether or not your organization has actually been breached. \\nTactics like this underscore the need for broad \\nand deep defenses. While we saw above that backups can help an organization buy time and reduce damage, they’re not enough on their own. \\nWe recommend organizations focus on the following \\nactions to increase their cyber resilience:\\nMaintain an incident response plan to prepare for \\nand respond to cyber incidents, including emerging ransomware tactics like extortion, multi-extortion and harassment. Organizations that continuously review, update, and test their incident response plans– ideally with input from cybersecurity experts–are much more likely to eﬀectively respond to and contain an active attack.\\nEnsure complete visibility of your attack surface.\\n75% of ransomware attacks and breaches /uniFB01elded by Unit 42’s Incident Response Team result from a common culprit–internet-facing attack surface exposure. Deploying solutions that provide centralized, near real-time visibility can help organizations identify and mitigate vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.Leverage the power of AI and automation\\nto modernize security operations and reduce the burden on overworked analysts. The latest technology can help organizations drive down cybersecurity metrics, like mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to respond (MTTR), denying attackers the time they need to compromise an organization’s systems or ex/uniFB01ltrate its data. Additionally, technique-based protections mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework can help defenses nimbly evolve in response to adversarial tactics.\\nImplement enterprise-wide Zero Trust \\nnetwork architecture. This is a fundamental security principle that assumes the network is already compromised and implements processes that continuously validate the user, device, application, and data in a controlled manner. Zero Trust network architecture creates layers of security that prevent or limit an attacker from successfully moving laterally around the network. This provides victims with more time to detect, properly contain and remediate the threat. \\nProtect cloud infrastructure and applications. \\nWith cloud migration accelerating, threat actors will continue to develop tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) designed to target and compromise cloud workloads. Organizations leveraging cloud infrastructure should implement a cloud security program and platform that oﬀers comprehensive cloud-native security.\\nIt’s also important to maintain relationships that \\nyou can access quickly for help. This may include local and regional law enforcement, outside and inside counsel, and incident response assistance. \\nWhile there is no silver bullet in cybersecurity, \\nprioritizing these recommendations will materially reduce the risk of falling victim to an attack. It also allows you to more eﬀectively contain an attack if one does occur and help increase resilience for the entire cybersecurity ecosystem.'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/2024-unit42-incident-response-report.pdf', 'page': 24}, page_content='25Incident Response Report 2024\\nInitial Access Vectors\\nFor each incident in the set, we assigned an initial access vector: the technique that gave \\nan attacker their /uniFB01rst access to the compromised environment. Figure 6 shows that in 2023, exploitation of internet-facing vulnerabilities shot to the top spot, displacing the previously perennial favorite, phishing. \\nThis chart shows the top four tactics ordered by their prevalence in 2023, and it omits the cases where the initial vector couldn’t be determined. \\nThe increases in software vulnerabilities exploitation and previously compromised \\ncredentials stand out, as does the decrease in phishing attacks. \\nThese changes are consistent with the higher-impact threat actors’ behavior we’ve seen. \\nAs we discussed elsewhere in this report, one of the major threat groups changed during 2023. They began the year focused on phishing and social engineering the end users themselves. As time went on, they moved toward taking over their accounts by social engineering the IT helpdesk or by abusing self-service password reset procedures. \\nThe growth of previously compromised credentials as an intrusion vector is also notable; \\na /uniFB01ve-times diﬀerence in just two years. This underscores the importance of encouraging people to use a diﬀerent password (or passwordless authentication) for every site.

We think there are a few \\nmeaningful bits.\\nVulnerability Exploits Remain Relevant\\nExploiting web applications and internet-facing software as a means of initial access \\ncame roaring back in 2023. It was the engine behind some of the largest-scale, most automated intrusions.\\nThis means that patch hygiene, along with attack surface reduction, is still relevant, still \\nimportant, and still hard to achieve comprehensively in large organizations.

We have more recommendations for mitigations later in this report.\\nDefending Against Human Nature Is the Hardest Job\\nSocial engineering fell behind software vulnerabilities for the number-one spot, but it’s \\nstill a problem.\\nPeople are wired to help each other. Social engineering works in many cases because the \\nattacker persuades someone to act against their own best interest, and a request for help does the trick. \\nMoreover, helping each other is one of the key goals of high-performing organizations. So, \\nwe are working against our own goals when we ask people not to trust each other or not to help someone who’s asking for assistance. \\nTechnology can help here, but process, education, and critical thinking are just as important.\\nBelt, Suspenders, and Extra Underwear\\nMulti-layered defense is one of the core best practices in incident resilience. All the \\nstatistics in this section are focused around initial access and the /uniFB01rst steps of an investigation. They’re all opportunities for defenders to place a mitigation, a control, or an alerting mechanism that will block, slow, or reveal an attacker’s activity.\\nBut none of these defenses succeeds alone. Almost any security control can be overcome \\nby a suﬃciently motivated, skilled, and resourced attacker. \\nThe most mature organizations protect everything with multiple layers, knowing that \\nattackers will identify and evade some controls, but they’ll also make mistakes.

Like asking these chatbots for help with starting a resume or with sending a work email, attackers are using them to craft more realistic phishing emails with fewer obvious errors. Deepfakes also become easier to create with AI, opening the door to misinformation or propaganda campaigns. \\nWe see signs that bad actors are using AI to attack organizations at a larger scale. They \\ncycle quickly through attack vectors to seek eﬀective ways in. Using AI makes it less expensive and faster to execute numerous simultaneous attacks aimed at exploiting multiple vulnerabilities. AI can also speed up post-exploitation activities such as lateral movement and reconnaissance. \\nMuch has been made of the potential for AI-generated malware. However, at this time, \\nour research suggests that AI is more useful to attackers as a co-author than as the sole creator of new malware. It is possible for attackers to use AI to assist with the development of speci/uniFB01c pieces of functionality in malware. However, uses of this type generally still require a knowledgeable human operator. The technology may still make it possible for attackers to develop new malware variants quicker and cheaper. \\nLooking ahead, our consultants tell us that aside from AI’s potential for speed, they’re also \\nconcerned about its potential for patience. An AI could theoretically engage in a long, slow-burn operation aimed at eventually /uniFB01nding a way into an organization–perhaps over a time period that a human would be unlikely to sustain. \\nThere’s also the possibility that attackers could compromise generative AI tools and large \\nlanguage models themselves. This could lead to data leakage, or perhaps poisoned results from impacted tools. \\nAI Also Oﬀers Hope for Defenders\\nDespite that list of how attackers can bene/uniFB01t from AI, it’s important not to fear AI. Embracing the technology for defense opens possibilities for defenders to anticipate, track, and thwart cyberattacks to an unprecedented degree. \\nAnyone familiar with the work of the cybersecurity industry knows how often we face \\ninformation overload. Mountains of security alerts come through every hour, of varying importance. Too often, defenders have to piece together data from disparate sources, while also trying to determine which of it really matters. According to industry research, more than 90% of SOCs are still dependent on manual processes. \\nAI oﬀers a way out of that Sisyphean struggle. AI is particularly eﬀective at pattern \\nrecognition, so cybersecurity threats that follow repetitive attack chains (such as ransomware) could be stopped earlier. While attackers may use AI to creatively identify new TTPs to obfuscate these chains, defenders could still leverage AI to detect and stop anomalous behavior.

We use AI-driven data analysis to \\nautomatically reduce that number to just eight events requiring manual analysis. Through this process, we have reduced our MTTD to just 10 seconds. Our MTTR sits at just one minute for high priority alerts. \\nSecurity operations metrics like this will be key to understanding the eﬃcacy of an AI-\\npowered security tool. Defenders should pay attention to not only MTTD and MTTR, but also to incident closure rates, as well as false positive rates and the false negative rates. Eﬀective tools should show clear bene/uniFB01ts to the organization by improving these metrics. \\nThose developing AI models can take steps to prevent threat actors from misusing their \\ncreations. By controlling access to the models, threat actors can be prevented from co-opting them freely for nefarious purposes. There is also the perpetual need to recognize con/uniFB01dential or sensitive information and build in ways to safeguard it. When a model detects this type of information, it may choose to block further queries or activity. \\nDesigners should also be aware of the potential to jailbreak large language models (LLMs) \\nby convincing them to answer questions that could contribute to bad behavior. Those creating AI models should consider that attackers will ask things like, “How do I increase the impact of an attack on a vulnerable Apache web server?” AI models should be hardened against lines of questioning like this. \\nOrganizations should also make an eﬀort to secure users accessing AI tools, ensuring \\nvisibility and control over how these services are being used within an enterprise environment. It’s important to set clear policies for the type of data users can feed into AI services, protecting proprietary or sensitive information from exposure to third parties. \\nWe believe the real risk of AI would be not recognizing it as the force multiplier it is, and \\nto miss the opportunity to use it to meaningfully improve the situation of defenders. This technology can both make us more eﬀective at protecting our organizations and oﬀer hope for work-life balance in a /uniFB01eld that too often feels always-on. AI can help make security data actionable, giving real-time visibility and the ability to prevent, detect, and respond to cyberattacks quickly.\\nDefenders have a responsibility to use AI as the resource it is.

In 2023, about 56% of the \\nmatters we investigated involved malware in one way or another. That was consistent with its prevalence in the prior few years.\\nBut while malware continues to be a problem, threat actors are increasingly “living oﬀ the \\nland,” using and misusing the tools and code that a target already has in their environment.\\nHow do those two statements (i.e., “consistent with prior years” and “increasingly living oﬀ \\nthe land”) go together ? The answer lies in the attackers’ mix of tools. As they /uniFB01nd system tools that can substitute for malware functions, they’ll adopt the system tools. Many intrusions still use malware at some point. More and more are using living-oﬀ-the-land techniques along with the malware.\\nEndpoint protection platforms continue to be a great way to detect attacker activity of this \\nkind. Even if the code isn’t malware per se, some platforms can discriminate between use and misuse by employing user and entity behavior analytics. Defenders who use this capability to identify investigative leads through alerting and/or hunting enhance their visibility.\\nFor example, a common certi/uniFB01cate utility on Windows called certutil can also be used to \\ndownload /uniFB01les, decode Base64-encoded software, and more. And it’s a signed binary from the Windows installation, not malware. Can you tell when a threat actor is misusing it? \\nSome endpoint protection platforms can detect and alert on this activity. Detection might \\nbe based on the following:\\n     The action’s novelty  (is it unusual for this endpoint to run certutil?)\\n     Its function (what data is certutil processing?)\\n     Its context\\nNow, let’s return to malware for a moment. \\nProbably the most visible type of malware is ransomware: when you’ve been hit with it, \\nattackers want you to know. Over the past year, 33% of the matters where malware was used involved ransomware. That was down slightly from last year, where it was 38%. However, we’re not saying “ransomware is down!” The changes are small, and the overall fraction of cases involving extortion with encryption was about the same in both years.\\nAnother high-impact malware capability is data destruction. It also creates widespread, \\nvisible eﬀects. In 2023 cases involving malware, it was used to destroy data 4.1% of the time. While that may not seem like a lot, it’s /uniFB01ve times the rate from the year before. Together with its operational impact, we think protecting against wipers and destroyers is critically important. And that’s especially true if you know you face threat actors who have used wipers in the past.\\nTime-based observations show that attackers are speeding up. Encryption and data \\ndestruction have dramatic and visible eﬀects. Thus, it’s wise to put eﬀort into preventing attackers from gaining execution in the /uniFB01rst place and exploiting it when they do.\\nWe think attackers will continue to innovate tools and techniques here.After the Compromise'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/2024-unit42-incident-response-report.pdf', 'page': 32}, page_content='33Incident Response Report 2024\\n33\\nSpotlight On:\\nSpeed\\nOrganizations Must Respond More \\nQuickly to Attacks\\nLike the rest of us, attackers are taking advantage of machine \\nspeed to do more, faster.

Case/uniFB01le: Black Basta Ransomware\\nIn certain kinds of cases, ex/uniFB01ltration happens \\neven faster. While we expected that extortion cases would be the fastest to ex/uniFB01ltration, that wasn’t the case. In matters that don’t involve extortion, attackers are working within hours more often than not. In 2022 and 2023, the median time to ex/uniFB01ltration for non-extortion matters has been less than one day. \\nWhile we can’t say for sure why this is, it may be \\nbecause in some cases data ex/uniFB01ltration is the attacker’s main goal. Attacker speed may be related to their focus–the faster the threat actors complete their mission, the more money they make. And the faster they work, the less time defenders have to get in their way.\\nThe bottom line is that, for many organizations, \\nex/uniFB01ltration may be underway before Incident Response and Legal teams have even assembled a response team and plan. It might even be complete.In one case involving Black Basta ransomware, it took attackers less than 14 hours to accomplish extensive compromise. Starting with a simple phishing email, the threat group gained initial entry to the organization a mere half hour later. From there, they explored the network, escalated privileges, and began communicating with their command and control (C2) server). \\nMost of this took place while the organization’s \\nsecurity team was home, asleep and unaware. By the time the team began to realize something was wrong, the attack was well underway. The attackers were ex/uniFB01ltrating terabytes of data. They had created multiple custom versions of ransomware. And those tools were staged on a server inside the target’s environment, ready to encrypt nearly 10,000 endpoints.'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/2024-unit42-incident-response-report.pdf', 'page': 34}, page_content='35Incident Response Report 2024\\n35\\nSpotlight On: Speed\\nOn the other side of the con/uniFB02ict, data from our incidents suggests \\ndefenders have not yet caught up to attacker speed. \\nLike most other incident response /uniFB01rms, we measure dwell time as \\nthe number of days an attacker is present in a victim environment before being detected. For this report, we measured the time between the /uniFB01rst detection of the attacker and the earliest evidence of the attacker’s presence. \\nThe good news is that we see dwell time decreasing since 2021.\\nMedian dwell time by year, days (all cases)\\nOn the /uniFB02ip side, even this decrease may not be enough. For \\nexample, in the US, the SEC adopted a rule requiring that material cybersecurity incidents be disclosed within four days. Given the time frames we observe, this could put organizations in the position of having to go public while still trying to /uniFB01gure out what happened–and what to say to customers, regulators, and the market.\\nThis is even more of a concern when one considers that simply \\ncontaining an attack may not be the same as fully remediating it. For example, an organization might contain an attack simply by deactivating compromised systems–a far cry from taking stock of the impact of the activity and fully restoring normal operations. \\nLatest Attacks \\nHappening in Hours – Time to Ex/uniFB01ltration is Often Less Than One Day\\nFigure 9.

In 2023, about 42% of our hacking-related investigations involved a backdoor, and 32% of malware-related matters had some kind of interactive C2 software. \\nBut as we note in our Spotlight on Muddled Libra, some attackers are moving back \\ntoward reverse tunnels. These tunnels are connections out of the target environment that terminate on a system under the attacker’s control in their infrastructure. These tunnels allow the attacker a great degree of freedom and often don’t require malware on the compromised system.\\nTo wit, tunneling tools are now built into most current operating systems. In the past, \\nattackers had to bring their own remote-access methods, often in the form of C2 tooling. They still do–commonly, a post-exploitation framework such as Cobalt Strike or an RMM tool–but they aren’t forced to. The operating system has built-in support for encrypted tunnels that may work just /uniFB01ne to evade notice by defenders.\\nRemote access tools are even less complicated to use. Microsoft Remote Desktop oﬀers \\na graphical user interface (GUI) to a networked system, and organizations are still leaving it open. The 2023 Unit 42 Attack Surface Threat Report found 85% of organizations analyzed in the report had at least one internet-accessible Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) instance online.\\nAnother classic technique we continue to see is the use of web shells, which allows an \\nattacker to use a compromised server as a beachhead into an environment. Placing a web shell on a system allows an attacker to continue to return over the long term. In 2023, we observed and reported on a series of APT intrusions in Southeast Asia that used web shells. We also observed web shells used as an attack vector in about 12% of hacking-related cases in 2023.\\nAttackers often use multiple persistence mechanisms. For example, in the attack against \\nthe Southeast Asian country, the threat actors\\n     Attempted to run their own custom backdoor software.\\nInstalled open-source VPN software to maintain access.\\n     Connected that VPN tunnel to two diﬀerent hosts with github.com domain names.After the Compromise\\n'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/2024-unit42-incident-response-report.pdf', 'page': 36}, page_content='37Incident Response Report 2024\\nDefense Evasion\\nIn 2023, evading the defenders was where some of the most interesting advances in \\nattacker conduct occurred. \\nReal-time Reaction\\nCertain attack groups, especially the most damaging ones, are less willing to give up and \\ngo home. Instead, they research, anticipate, and respond to incident response actions. \\nOur Muddled Libra threat assessment explores several examples. As we said there:\\n“Muddled Libra has been methodical in pursuing their goals and highly /uniFB02exible with \\ntheir attack strategies. When an attack path is blocked, they have either rapidly pivoted to another vector or modi/uniFB01ed the environment to allow their favored path.\\n“The Muddled Libra threat group also repeatedly demonstrated a strong \\nunderstanding of the modern incident response (IR) framework. This knowledge allows them to continue progressing toward their goals even as incident responders attempt to expel them from an environment.”\\nSaid another way, this threat actor puts up a /uniFB01ght. They try to steal /uniFB01les that will tell them how their target is going to react once the victim identi/uniFB01es compromise activity. Then, they use that knowledge to install additional means of access that anticipate the response.\\nWe expect to see more of this kind of behavior in the future.\\nAdding Attacker-Controlled Infrastructure\\nPerhaps most interestingly, we’ve seen a trend of attackers connecting their own \\ninfrastructure to a target’s environment. More than just living oﬀ the land, they’re actively installing and con/uniFB01guring new systems in the target’s environment that are controlled by the attacker, not the defender. \\nUnit 42 observed and captured a novel BlackCat ransomware tactic in October 2023. \\nThis ransomware-as-a-service threat actor provides comparatively advanced tool sets to its aﬃliates. \\nOne advance we noticed was a tool named Munchkin. Munchkin provides a Linux-based \\nvirtual machine that the ransomware operator installs and runs on a compromised system, circumventing host-based security controls in many cases. \\nBlackCat is no longer alone in using this tactic. The Ragnar Locker group has also been \\nreported to use it. We expect to see this tactic more often.\\nAnother tactic we’ve seen used to great eﬀect is Okta cross-tenant impersonation \\n(discussed publicly in Okta’s blog post from August 2023). In this tactic, a threat actor uses highly privileged accounts to add a second, attacker-controlled identity provider (IdP). Then, the attacker federates their IdP to the target’s true IdP. At that point, the attacker can sign on to applications at the target as any user. This is misuse of a legitimate function, so preventing it requires vigilance and tight permission management.After the Compromise'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/2024-unit42-incident-response-report.pdf', 'page': 37}, page_content='38Incident Response Report 2024\\nA third tactic we’ve observed is attackers standing up their own cloud workloads in the \\ntarget’s cloud infrastructure. Why not? It’s incredibly fast and easy, and the target will pay the bill! This approach also blends in with normal IT or DevOps operations. It’s not at all unusual, and most SOC teams will breeze right past it. \\nWe expect attackers will continue to add infrastructure under their control. Defending \\nagainst it means creating and maintaining a comprehensive understanding of the contents of your environment, one of the hardest maintenance tasks a security team faces.\\nIronically, this may be one area where the cloud is easier to manage. If you have access \\nto cloud discovery and security posture management tools, you may /uniFB01nd ways you could detect unmanaged systems and accounts that have skirted your security controls. It may only require a friendly relationship with the people who run the cloud infrastructure management plane! \\nDisguising Host- and Network-Based Activity\\nFinally, a few classic tactics remain in the mix. Over the course of many investigations, we \\nhave seen threat actors take actions to try to avoid detection. Here are a few examples.\\nThe /uniFB01rst tactic is to try to appear normal. Unit 42 researchers identi/uniFB01ed a Chinese APT \\ngroup that was doing this in several ways. (We haven’t connected this activity to a named group yet.)\\nThe threat actors had created C2 infrastructure hosted on a half dozen internet-facing \\nsystems, with domain names that suggest they’re cloud storage services. A security analyst could easily wave away large data transfers to a cloud provider. It’s pretty normal. However, further analysis revealed that the same SSL certi/uniFB01cate was being used on all the servers, which is inconsistent with their disparate network locations and hostnames.\\nThis actor also appeared to install honeypot software on the C2 servers. This too could \\npersuade a hurried analyst to dismiss the suspect connections as benign, seeing known security testing tools. \\nA diﬀerent threat actor, Stately Taurus, took an even simpler approach. Their C2 \\nconnections used HTTP POST methods that set the host /uniFB01eld to a Microsoft domain name, despite the traﬃc being directed to an IP address in Malaysia with no relation to any legitimate Microsoft service. \\nThe second tactic is related: a threat actor disguising themselves by changing their \\nbehavior, depending on who’s asking. \\nThe unnamed APT group’s C2 servers seemed to change during the course of a day. \\nThey only accepted C2 connections during the threat actor’s activity times and were closed at other times. While this may have helped the threat actor defend against casual observation, it looks unusual to the non-casual observer. Systems that change behavior based on time of day are uncommon.\\nAnd /uniFB01nally, the threat actor seemed to be /uniFB01ltering connections to the C2 infrastructure. \\nThey blocked connections from known Palo Alto Networks IP ranges, as well as some other cybersecurity companies and hosting providers.After the Compromise'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/2024-unit42-incident-response-report.pdf', 'page': 38}, page_content='39Incident Response Report 2024\\nThese measures are an attempt to minimize the risk of being pro/uniFB01led by IP scanners. \\nBut they raise interesting investigative questions once they’re observed in a potential attack context.\\nAnd the third tactic was host-based, rather than network-based. An Iran-based actor \\nwe call Agonizing Serpens tried to evade (EDR) solutions on the systems they had compromised. While most of the techniques they tried were well-known already, this threat actor hadn’t previously been reported to use them. \\nThe threat actor attempted at least three EDR bypass techniques. In this speci/uniFB01c case, the \\ntarget was using Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR\\n®–and the techniques did not succeed. \\nBut these oﬀensive tactics could be applied to many defensive security tools.\\nThose techniques were:\\n      Trying to keep the EDR from auto-starting by disabling prerequisites; then      Installing an anti-rootkit kernel driver and using it to try to stop a running process \\nin the EDR tool; and /uniFB01nally\\n      Trying a second vulnerable-driver-to-process-kill technique from a recently \\npublished proof of concept.\\nThe Unit 42 Threat Research Center has more analysis of the technique. The key \\ntakeaway, though, was that the group’s use of evasive tactics and tools seems to indicate an upgraded capability compared to their past activity.After the Compromise\\n'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/2024-unit42-incident-response-report.pdf', 'page': 39}, page_content='40Incident Response Report 2024\\nDiscovery and Lateral Movement\\nThe big news in lateral movement this year was turnabout. We found attackers using \\nsecurity tools oﬀensively. \\nMany security tools need elevated privileges. It’s wise to minimize those privileges, but \\nsome tools must run with the privileges attackers seek. For example, EDR/XDR tools usually can access and change any data on a system. That’s the nature of the beast.\\nThis year, attackers took that beast by the horns. We saw them compromise accounts \\nbelonging to security personnel with high privileges. Then, they used those accounts to access security tools that gave the attackers access to every system across the organization. And they used that access to move about and achieve their objectives.\\nOther TTPs of discovery and lateral movement remained familiar from prior years. Threat \\nactors tend to use a variety of system administration tools at this phase, most of which are not malicious code and are frequently used by authorized personnel. Infostealers remain a common discovery (and sometimes initial access) vector for attackers.\\nNonetheless, there are detection opportunities. Internal port scanning is a quick way for a newly arrived threat actor to get the lay of the \\nland. It’s also noticeable. Watching for these actions with endpoint and network-based detection is wise.\\nThreat actors often use RDP connections to move laterally within a target environment, \\neven if it is not accessible externally. RDP oﬀers many user-friendly conveniences for interactive access and can leave a light evidence footprint. Logging RDP use generates a lot of data, but it is a great detective control. This is probably one of those areas where AI can be helpful to sift through masses of data.\\nThreat actors also frequently use Server Message Block (SMB) protocol for lateral \\nmovement since they know defenders will often assume this is standard /uniFB01le sharing activity.\\nAccess logs for security tools (and IT tools that run with elevated security privileges) can \\nreveal unusual access patterns.

This shows us two things: threat actors are well aware of the value of cloud accounts in a distributed work environment, and they’re willing to take roundabout ways to get access.\\nAs the author of our article on these incidents described \\nit, “When a threat actor understands the underlying technology used by cloud service providers, they can accomplish a great deal if they can gain access to credentials that have the right permissions.” They can take advantage of vulnerabilities in a wide variety of cloud services to get that initial access to /uniFB01nd the credentials they need.'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/2024-unit42-incident-response-report.pdf', 'page': 41}, page_content='42Incident Response Report 2024\\n42\\nSpotlight On: Cloud Incidents\\nSheltering from the Clouds\\nMany organizations believe that choosing cloud services \\nobviates the need for them to think about security. And in fairness, many cloud service providers sell their products as if they’ve taken care of all that dirty work. But identity and access management (IAM) is always the responsibility of the organization rather than the cloud service provider, and miscon/uniFB01gurations can undo even the most secure products.\\nAccording to our latest Cloud Report, Volume 7, at least \\nthree-quarters (76%) of organizations don’t enforce MFA for console users, and 58% of organizations don’t enforce MFA for root or admin users.\\nWhile every organization has a small set of risky behaviors \\nthat are repeatedly observed in their cloud workloads, that also means that a few changes will make a big diﬀerence to your overall security. In most organizations’ cloud environments, 5% of security rules trigger 80% of alerts.\\nForecasts Include Increasing Cloud \\nCover\\nWhile the rapid increase in remote work due to the \\npandemic caused a huge growth in cloud adoption, there is still more cloud coverage in our immediate forecast. Threat actors know this and are adapting their techniques to take advantage of this change in infrastructure.\\nFigure 10 shows that we’ve seen an increase in incident \\nresponses involving cloud cases, from 6% in 2021 to 16.6% in 2023. This matches an overall trend in organizations’ environments relying more heavily on cloud infrastructure.\\nPlanning for a Rainy Day\\nThis increase of interest in cloud \\nadoption for both organizations and threat actors gives us some unique opportunities. Cloud computing is not going away anytime soon, as it oﬀers a lot of productivity (and even security) bene/uniFB01ts for organizations that adopt it. For those who move quickly to improve their security, they have a rare chance to get ahead of threat actor activity.\\nThere are several things you can focus on to \\nmake a big diﬀerence in your cloud security:\\n•  Enforce MFA. Having proper \\nauthentication on cloud service accounts \\nis a way to make things harder for threat actors to access your environment. \\n•  Protect your data. Sensitive data is \\nat risk from both insider and external attacks. According to our last Cloud Threat Report, personally identi/uniFB01able information (PII), /uniFB01nancial records, or intellectual property, are found in 66% of storage buckets and 63% of publicly exposed storage buckets\\n•  Monitor abnormal activity. If services \\nwithin your cloud account are accessing or being accessed by new and unusual IP addresses or over unusual ports, make sure your monitoring is con/uniFB01gured to alert on this activity.\\n•  React quickly. Moving quickly to \\naddress security alerts can signi/uniFB01cantly limit damage. Security teams take on average about 6 days to resolve a security alert. Over 60% of organizations take longer than four days to resolve security issues.\\n•  Implement the principle of least \\nprivilege. Granting least-privilege permissions is the most eﬀective way to minimize the impact of security incidents. In our Cloud Threat Report, Volume 6, we found that 99% of the cloud users, roles, services, and resources were granted excessive permissions.\\nFigure 10. An increase in cloud cases from 2021 to 2023'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/2024-unit42-incident-response-report.pdf', 'page': 42}, page_content='43Incident Response Report 2024\\nCredential Access\\nWe continue to see threat actors using \\ncredential-dumping tools such as Mimikatz and MiniDump to extract user account credentials and password hashes. They also use tools targeting Windows Active Directory domain controllers themselves. Endpoint detections are the best way to /uniFB01nd these. Investigate them promptly when they occur.\\nAnd watch for customized versions that will \\nevade hash-based detection. We observed a threat actor using their own version of Mimikatz, \\nrequiring a password on the command line and omitting some of the usual features. Detect these tools by their behavior–attempting to steal information from memory–rather than just their hash, /uniFB01lename, or other easily changed attributes.\\nNot Just Passwords\\nMore importantly, attackers are shifting more \\nfocus to stealing sessions, not just credentials. We have seen a variety of actors using “stealer” tools to extract saved passwords, session tokens, and other artifacts from browser and application caches on endpoints. \\nSession tokens in particular can pose a signi/uniFB01cant \\nrisk if they are long-lived and the system they’re presented to has weak anomaly detection. With those tokens in hand, the threat actor assumes the identity and privileges of an authenticated user. They can perform all the same actions, use all the same authorizations. Would your tools notice if a session token was suddenly used in a diﬀerent location than its owner?Collection and Ex/uniFB01ltration\\nOver the past year, we saw vulnerabilities weaponized and exploited more rapidly and on a larger scale than in prior years. We have observed a trend toward the automation of campaigns–similar to the “scaling up” process seen in manufacturing–from prototype to mass production. \\nThe /uniFB01rst attempts at exploitation are conducted \\ninteractively, by hand. Then, there’s a progression of automation from tools to assist human operators to machine-driven exploitation of the weaknesses. \\nAutomating Theft\\nThreat actors are also automating post-\\nexploitation activity. In particular, the size of the MOVEit Transfer published victim list is consistent with automation not just of the exploit, but also the collection and ex/uniFB01ltration of the data. \\nWith MOVEit compromises, automation \\nof collection and ex/uniFB01ltration was relatively straightforward because the stolen data itself was resident on the compromised, internet-facing server.\\nToo Much Stolen Data\\nBut then, the threat actor, (CL0P) was faced with \\na diﬀerent problem. Having stolen all that data, to eﬀectively extort the targets, the threat actor had to publish some of it.\\nUnfortunately for the threat actor, the usual \\nmethods of extortion weren’t able to handle the sheer volume of data they had stolen. Download speeds over Tor were too slow. They had to resort to publishing by torrent, which opened them up to further investigation by responders and researchers.\\nLook for more from Unit 42 on this case in the \\nfuture.After the Compromise'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/2024-unit42-incident-response-report.pdf', 'page': 43}, page_content='44Incident Response Report 2024\\nImpact\\nIn the last year, clients felt more impact than previously, from lost con/uniFB01dentiality through \\nlost revenue.\\nThe eﬀects of an incident last a lot longer than the attack and investigation itself. While \\nreputation and share prices usually recover to their pre-incident levels, there are always soft and hard economic costs. \\nData Exposure\\nOne of the /uniFB01rst questions a target asks after discovering a potential security incident is \\nwhether non-public information was disclosed, exposed, or compromised. Figure 11 shows that while we are able to answer that question most of the time, the answer continues to trend toward a more costly response.\\nOver 80% of the time, we can answer this question with a “yes,” “no,” or “maybe.” Within \\nthat set, the “maybes” are eating away at the “nos,” and the “yesses” are growing too.

Figure 12 shows that the answer here has a pronounced trend toward indiscriminate ex/uniFB01ltration. After the Compromise\\nFigure 12. Non-targeted data theft dominated in 2023\\nWe say the data was targeted if the threat actor selected what data they were after. For example, they may have performed keyword searches, applied criteria, or /uniFB01ltered their /uniFB01le collection patterns. Filtering by extension, size, date range, or pattern matching–all of these are targeting actions.\\nLooking at 2023 in isolation, it’s tempting to point at the large sweep-the-internet \\ncompromise campaigns and say that’s why the not-targeted number is so high this year. But there seems to be a pronounced growth in the tactic of attackers just collecting it all and sorting it out later. Attackers are also moving to ex/uniFB01ltrate much sooner than in the past, which aligns with this grab-and-go strategy.\\nSo the large volume of ex/uniFB01ltrated data is  a bit of a double-edged sword. On the one hand, \\nit’s easier to detect large volumes of ex/uniFB01ltration than smaller, targeted transfers. On the other hand, when the stolen data is so big, the task of impact analysis and noti/uniFB01cation also gets a lot bigger. On the third hand, you’d need to detect that big ex/uniFB01ltration a lot earlier in the incident lifecycle. It might even be the /uniFB01rst sign you notice that something is afoot, and you’ll need to act on it fast.\\nDefenders should look at this trend as an encouragement to buy or build capabilities to \\ndetect attacker activity sooner, to accelerate response actions to interrupt the attack.\\n'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/2024-unit42-incident-response-report.pdf', 'page': 45}, page_content='46Incident Response Report 2024\\nWas Business Interrupted?\\nAs we said earlier, when you’ve been hit with a destructive or extortion-encryption tool, you \\nknow it.

There’s a clear trend of greater public \\nawareness of large-scale cybersecurity incidents.

For this section, we’re talking about prevalence–how many of our clients experienced that type of cost–rather than dollar losses.\\nWhat part of the business does an incident response aﬀect? It’s not just in the IT \\ndepartment. And the cost of response isn’t only the consulting fees.

In the last two-and-a-half years, over 86% of our clients had some kind of legal or regulatory cost. And over 78% of them had recovery costs.\\nWhile it can be easier to prepare for losses that you expect, it’s always harder to prepare \\nfor losses that you don’t yet understand or can’t predict. \\nIn our experience, the best way to address that discrepancy happens when you can \\nidentify all the parties who would be involved in a large-scale incident response.

Fixing these issues proactively lowers the chances or impact of a cyberattack.\\nNot Enough Visibility\\nYou can’t protect what you can’t see. \\nOrganizations chronically lack comprehensive visibility across their network, cloud, and endpoints. This shortfall led to critical unmonitored areas, delaying the detection of and response to active threats.\\nLack of visibility also led to uncontrolled and \\nunmanaged vulnerabilities. In 11.5% of the incidents, insuﬃcient patch management was a contributing factor. \\nVisibility gaps also led to unnecessary resource \\nexposure, such as internet-exposed remote desktops or inadequately secured cloud workloads. These exposures contributed to 9.6% of cases. \\nFinally, insuﬃcient coverage with endpoint \\nprotection technology was a contributing factor in 13.6% of the IR engagements we responded to.\\nThese unmonitored areas provided attackers \\nwith opportunities and time to exploit weaknesses. Not having a comprehensive view across the attack surface–crucial for managing it eﬀectively–signi/uniFB01cantly contributed to incident severity and frequency.Too Much Complexity\\nIn our post-breach investigations, we often /uniFB01nd \\nforensic evidence of what happened in the logs and digital artifacts. But this data is often spread across many diﬀerent security point products, buried in millions of uncorrelated alerts, or structured in disparate formats. That distribution discourages automated prevention, detection, or real time response by security analysts.\\nThis data issue gets worse when teams struggle \\nto maintain expertise in the myriad of tools they’ve adopted for security operations. As a result, even when the early signs of an attack exist, the signal is lost in the complexity of the IT landscape.\\nDefenders miss critical attack indicators when \\nthey’re overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information and operational demands. They can’t see the forest for the trees. \\nToo Much Privilege\\nAllocating excess privileges to accounts is a \\ntoo-common contributing factor in cybersecurity breaches. Over-privileged accounts give attackers the means to move laterally across an environment, accessing sensitive information and assets. Attackers particularly target administrative accounts because they can be used to gain access to other systems and accounts. Using those privileges ampli/uniFB01es the breach’s impact.\\nThis issue is especially acute in cloud \\nenvironments, where Unit 42 research has discovered that 99% of accounts are over-permissioned. Extensive cloud privileges exacerbate the risk and potential damage of attacks. \\nNot Enough Authentication\\nFinally, the lack of MFA remains signi/uniFB01cant.

These guidelines can be a blueprint to bolster your defenses and avoid severe incidents like those chronicled in this report. \\nRemember, never let a good incident go to waste!\\nGet Visibility Across Your External and Internal Attack Surface\\nCriminals have more surface to attack than ever before. The continued adoption of \\nbring-your-own-device practices, internet of things, and cloud-native applications and architectures continues to add vulnerabilities and miscon/uniFB01gurations. \\nIn the cloud, hard-coded credentials, weak authentication, and ineﬃcient alert handling \\nlead to increased breach risk. \\nTo make matters worse, the modern attack surface is in constant /uniFB02ux. On average, 20% \\nof an organization’s cloud attack surface is replaced each month with new or updated services, contributing to nearly half of new critical exposures. \\nAdditionally, over 85% of organizations expose RDP to the internet for a signi/uniFB01cant part of \\neach month. Doing so increases the risk of ransomware attacks and unauthorized access  .\\nGet ahead of this now by establishing tools and processes that allow you to get your arms \\naround your internal and external attack surface, including cloud, network, and endpoints. \\nExternal Attack Surface Management (ASM)\\nTo manage your external attack surface, including cloud and internet-facing assets, \\n/uniFB01rst identify and control what you have. Use advanced scanning tools and services that specialize in discovering and cataloging external-facing assets, such as web applications, cloud storage, APIs, and any services exposed to the internet. \\nThen, protect that external access with MFA. Don’t allow remote access (especially RDP) \\nwith just a username and password. Require a second factor of authentication, either behind a VPN or natively in the solution. \\nIf you do nothing else, do this.Next, continuously assess these assets for vulnerabilities and miscon/uniFB01gurations using \\nactive ASM applications and a cloud-native application protection platform (CNAPP). \\nImplement a rigorous process to remediate identi/uniFB01ed vulnerabilities and miscon/uniFB01gurations \\nquickly.

Prioritize methods like \\napp-based or hardware tokens. Avoid SMS second factor if you can. It is vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks that threat actors regularly perform.\\nPasswordless solutions. Where feasible, employ passwordless authentication methods \\nsuch as biometric veri/uniFB01cation or FIDO2 security keys. These methods eliminate common \\nattack vectors associated with passwords.\\nSingle sign-on (SSO). Use SSO to reduce password fatigue and streamline user access, \\nwhile maintaining stringent security checks.\\nRegular auditing and updating. Conduct frequent audits of authentication protocols. \\nEnsure all methods are up to date and comply with the latest security standards. Find outliers and “temporary” exceptions that outlived their usefulness.\\nUser education. Continuously educate users about safe authentication practices, including \\nthe importance of securing their authentication tools and recognizing phishing attempts. Session management. Implement strict session management policies, including \\nautomatic logout after periods of inactivity and reauthentication for sensitive actions.\\nAim for Principle of Least Privilege\\nUser and system accounts accumulate excessive privileges with evolving technology, \\nworkforce changes, and organizational growth. This accumulation magni/uniFB01es organizational risk and eases attackers’ eﬀorts to move within your organization and access sensitive data.\\nAudit identity and access management comprehensively. Implement rigorous need-\\nto-know access controls. Pay special attention to cached credentials on endpoints, as attackers such as Muddled Libra exploit them, even from accounts protected by a privileged access management application. Minimize privileges for each credential, segregate them eﬀectively, and continuously monitor how they’re being used. Look for anomalies.\\nEnsure credentials expire when their owner no longer needs them. Grant access only \\nwhen needed. Audit and monitor the use of long-lived, highly privileged credentials, restricting their scope to only essential roles and individuals.\\nPrivileged users should have dedicated accounts for critical functions, like domain \\ncontrollers or Microsoft Active Directory management. Separate these accounts from their regular user accounts. Doing so reduces the “blast radius” of a compromise. Over-privileged accounts can dramatically increase the impact of a breach, so minimizing privileges is key to containment.\\nFinally, segregate service accounts so that each has only one elevated privilege.

Or, at least, monitor and alert on them.\\nSegment Networks and Control Infrastructure\\nNetwork segmentation is a key tactic to apply Zero Trust principles to network architecture\\nand infrastructure. This strategy eﬀectively impedes the lateral movement of threats and con/uniFB01nes breaches to isolated zones, signi/uniFB01cantly reducing the breach’s impact. \\nZero Trust network access (ZTNA) plays a critical role in this context. ZTNA veri/uniFB01es users \\nand grants them access to speci/uniFB01c applications based on identity and context policies. It eliminates implicit trust and restricts network movement to decrease attack surfaces  . \\nRegardless of their location, no users or devices trying to gain access to a network are \\ntrusted until they’ve been fully veri/uniFB01ed based on identity and access control policies  . This approach contrasts with traditional VPNs, which often grant complete access to an internal network.

Doing so misses critical alerts and leaves vulnerabilities exposed. Over 90% of SOCs still rely on these manual processes, giving adversaries an unnecessary advantage.\\nCollecting logs from security point products \\nacross your network, endpoints, and cloud can generate billions of events every day. Generating the telemetry is a great /uniFB01rst step. The next one is to make sure this data is correlated, stitched together, and analyzed in a way that your defenders can take action on.\\nConsolidate your security tools and use \\nextended detection and response (XDR) and/or extended security intelligence and automation management (XSIAM). They provide a uni/uniFB01ed platform that captures security telemetry from endpoints, networks, and cloud environments. Then, they give you a more streamlined and eﬀective approach to threat detection and response. \\nThese tools harness the power of machine \\nlearning and analytics to act as a force multiplier for the SOC analyst. This technology reduces detection and response times, shifting the advantage back to the defenders. \\nIn our own networks, we have put this into \\npractice:\\n•  On average, we ingest 36 billion events daily. \\nAI-driven data analysis triages this data \\nto a manageable eight events that need manual analysis.\\n•  MTTD: We have reduced this critical metric to \\njust 10 seconds.\\n•  MTTR: High priority alerts are now addressed \\nwithin one minute.And these results aren’t unique to us.

Based on the incidents we responded to over the past \\nyear, here are some of the key items to watch for.\\nAuthentication and MFA. Create rules to identify impossible logon scenarios such \\nas geographic anomalies. Regularly audit MFA enrollment to ensure comprehensive \\nimplementation and identify gaps in logging. This thorough approach is critical for detecting and alerting on outliers and unusual usage, not just failed logins. Set up alerts for repeated authentication failures or unanswered attempts, which could indicate an attacker’s eﬀorts to overwhelm or misdirect authentication requests.\\nRemote Access. Given the risks associated with RDP abuse, it’s crucial to restrict \\nand closely monitor remote access. Assess and minimize the list of authorized remote \\nmanagement tools. Unauthorized tools should be blocked and monitored for, increasing the chances of detecting attacker activity. Clearly de/uniFB01ne and enforce which remote management tools are approved for business use.\\nPrivilege Escalation. While it may be challenging for larger organizations to track all \\nprivilege changes, focusing on high-privilege accounts is essential. Log these changes \\nand, if possible, correlate them with change control processes. Use identity threat detection and response tools to spot abnormal behaviors and collaborate across departments for work/uniFB02ow and communication improvements.\\nDefense evasion.  Set up alerts for known defense evasion tactics like disabling host-\\nbased /uniFB01rewalls or antivirus programs. Quick investigation and response to these alerts are \\nkey. For businesses where the risk is acceptable, consider automatic containment measures.\\nLiving oﬀ the Land. Be aware that skilled threat actors, like Muddled Libra, may attempt \\nto use your security tools against you. This includes using endpoint protection for unauthorized commands or data loss protection tools to locate and ex/uniFB01ltrate sensitive information. Strictly monitor access to these tools, investigate any anomalies, and consider separate authentication infrastructure for critical security applications.\\nEx/uniFB01ltration. Unusual spikes in data transfer or accessing sensitive data repositories \\noutside normal patterns should trigger alerts. Implementing network analysis tools can help in detecting and preventing data ex/uniFB01ltration attempts.Recommendations for Defenders\\nRecommended Unit 42 Services:\\n• Compromise Assessment\\n• SOC Assessment• Managed Threat Hunting• Managed Detection and ResponseRecommended \\nPalo Alto Network Products:\\n• Cortex Xpanse\\n• Cortex XDR• Cortex XSIAM'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/2024-unit42-incident-response-report.pdf', 'page': 56}, page_content='57Incident Response Report 2024\\nRespond More Eﬀectively by Conducting Regular Incident Simulation and Testing\\nIn an incident response, the diﬀerence between those organizations that have tested \\nand prepared and those making plans for the /uniFB01rst time is night and day.

Doing so hinges on the preparedness and resilience of systems and backups, coupled with specialized expertise. Re/uniFB02ecting on the incidents we’ve encountered over the past year, several key lessons emerge.\\nSpecialized expertise matters. Diverse \\nchallenges require diverse skill sets. Recognize \\nyour team’s strengths and identify areas where external expertise would augment your own. \\nSpecialized knowledge in breach-related legal \\nissues, crisis communication, forensic analysis, threat hunting, negotiation with threat actors, emergency remediation, and threat intelligence are often crucial. Establish relationships with trusted partners in these areas beforehand. Standing retainers or contractual agreements ensure the immediate availability of these resources during a crisis.\\nImmutable, usable backups preserve value.\\nRansomware attackers target backups, so it’s imperative to protect them through segmentation, whether that means storing them oﬄine or using other access controls. Regularly test and con/uniFB01rm the eﬀectiveness of your backups. Assess how swiftly you can restore critical components, like domain controllers or essential production systems, from these backups.\\nPrepare for rapid containment. Be prepared \\nfor a scenario where a complete credential reset \\nis the only viable option. This process–often disruptive–can involve resetting passwords, unenrolling MFA devices, rotating API keys, or renewing Kerberos tickets. Mitigate the impact by planning this process meticulously before you need to do it. Document the reset protocol and store it securely oﬄine to prevent unauthorized access by attackers.Refresh the incident response plan. A well-documented incident response plan outlines roles, procedures, and timelines. The plan should detail the steps for a rapid and comprehensive reset to minimize disruption. Store this plan securely and ensure it’s accessible oﬄine–an essential consideration if your network is compromised and online resources are unavailable.\\nOut-of-band communications capability. \\nAnticipate that attackers might be privy to your response strategies. Establish an out-of-band communication system for incident response, separate from your primary network. \\nThis system should have its own identity \\nand access management, ideally hosted on an entirely diﬀerent platform.

Instead, automate. \\nCortex Xpanse is an active ASM solution that \\nhelps actively discover, learn about, and respond to risks in exposed systems and services. \\nReactively, we use Cortex Xpanse during \\nincident response to /uniFB01nd a client’s entire attack surface. Several times, it’s shown us an attacker’s entry point that the client didn’t even know they had. \\nProactively, ASM is part of our Unit 42 Attack \\nSurface Assessment service. It boosts your visibility into internet-connected assets, and we recommend actions you can take to better defend your organization. \\nEndpoint Protection\\nLack of centrally managed endpoint protection \\nwas a signi/uniFB01cant contributing factor in 2023 incidents. Attackers are great at /uniFB01nding the unprotected sections of the infrastructure.\\nNaturally, we recommend Cortex XDR as our /uniFB01rst \\nchoice. It’s an extended detection and response platform that integrates data from the endpoint as well as other sources. We particularly like how it can stitch together endpoint, network, cloud, and identity data. That helps with attack detection, and it also simpli/uniFB01es our investigations by putting all the data together for us. It can do the same for you.Cortex XDR also uses AI-driven technology for analytics, threat insights, /uniFB01le and incident analysis. That’s in line with our goal to use automation-/uniFB01rst processes that scale, because attackers are scaling, too.\\nDuring a live incident response, we often \\nalso need endpoint controls for capabilities like endpoint isolation, exploit and execution prevention. Cortex XDR does that for us as well.\\nUnit 42 conducts Compromise Assessment\\nengagements using Cortex XDR. These assessments answer the key question: “Am I compromised?” We use extensive telemetry data from your environment together with data from Palo Alto Networks customers worldwide and Unit 42 threat intelligence to identify threats and vulnerabilities in your organization.\\nWe prioritize our recommendations and align \\nthem with your security strategy. (We can help you develop that strategy, too.) Then you can move forward with implementation more con/uniFB01dent that you’re strengthening your defenses.\\nAutomation and Orchestration\\nThreat actors are creating larger and faster \\neﬀects, consistent with their use of playbooks and automation. Defenders should automate as well.\\nIn our own Palo Alto Networks SOC, we \\nuse Cortex XSOAR\\n®. We’ve measured its \\nperformance in our environment, and it does the work of 16 full-time employees, saving our analysts an average of 2,600 hours per month. If you have invested in creating playbooks and processes but struggle to get them automated, XSOAR is a great place to start.\\nUnit 42 Incident Response oﬀers several \\nproactive assessments that relate to automation. If you’ve built or are thinking about building a next-generation SOC, our SOC Assessment can help you design and build that capability. If you already have processes in place, consider our Ransomware Readiness Assessment or BEC Readiness Assessment to evaluate them.

The \\nframework we recommend to clients is ZTNA 2.0, integrating authentication with /uniFB01ne-grained least-privileged access. Access to organization resources should be minimal, continuously evaluated and comprehensive.\\nPalo Alto Networks Prisma Access is purpose-built, cloud-delivered and reduces risk. It \\ndelivers many networking and security services, from /uniFB01rewalls-as-a-service through SD-WAN and malware blocking. The feature list is long. \\nCortex XSIAM has Identity Threat Detection and Response that combines behavior \\nanalytics with identity threat detection to respond to threats like insider, data ex/uniFB01ltration, lateral movement, and other actions. \\nAnd because identity authentication is a key part of ZTNA 2.0, we recommend phishing-\\nresistant second factor authentication, such as FIDO2 keys. Move on this as quickly as you can. \\nUnit 42 Incident Response oﬀers several engagements around ZTNA 2.0. Our Cyber Risk \\nAssessment and Security Program Design, for example, helps you de/uniFB01ne a defense-in-depth strategy that can align with this framework.\\nPreventive Technology Controls\\nMany organizations can’t answer the question, “Which remote management tools are \\napproved for business use?” De/uniFB01ne and enforce an answer.\\nCortex XSIAM has embedded ASM capabilities that let you /uniFB01nd outliers to the answer.To minimize the risk of data ex/uniFB01ltration to unapproved locations, you’ll need more than just \\npacket /uniFB01lters.

AI has technological bene/uniFB01ts for both attackers and defenders, principally around scale. We think attackers will leverage those bene/uniFB01ts with greater sophistication and scale, speci/uniFB01cally around social engineering.\\nWe expect to see attackers using AI tools with \\ngreater sophistication and scale than today. We expect they will target voters, seeking to create friction within and among political groups.\\nAnd we expect to see this activity play out within \\norganizations, as well. AI will enable attackers to operate at greater scale, creating more (though not necessarily better) social engineering content. This AI-enabled content will become harder to discriminate from “authentic” content. Organizations will become increasingly reliant on advanced detection capabilities to bridge the resulting detection gap. Now is the time to stimulate awareness of and preparation for handling inauthentic AI-enabled information.\\nEncrypted Data Stockpiles\\nQuantum computing is still a decidedly futuristic capability. Nevertheless, when it eventually becomes available, attackers will suddenly be able to decrypt material that was previously impenetrable.\\nWe expect to see attackers harvesting and storing \\nencrypted data, with an eye toward one day breaking it open using quantum cryptography. \\nOrganizations should take stock of the encrypted \\ndata under their control, noting what has been stolen in the past that could become unprotected in the future. Organizations should also understand and increase their resistance to quantum threats as part of system design and operation.DevOps Expertise Will Expand \\nFurther\\nDevOps (and SecDevOps, and any number of \\nother mashed-together words to describe IT) has enabled defenders to scale technology operations to better operate and secure their organizations. \\nWe expect attackers will demonstrate their skills and \\nexpertise in DevOps, IT, and security as well. They will use their target’s existing IT and security tools to meet their own malicious needs. We expect to see attackers manipulate and subvert security controls to evade detection and persist within the target environment – without needing malware.\\nOrganizations should assess the security of \\ntheir security. Review the authentication and authorization controls around DevOps and security tools, and then establish compensating controls and procedures to protect your protections.\\nLarge Language Models Will \\nSeed Disinformation\\nLLMs have rapidly become the go-to tools for \\nanyone who needs to create large volumes of text. LLMs are good at creating plausible text, even if it’s not always grounded in reality.\\nWe expect attackers will look for opportunities \\nto seed disinformation at the source. They will manipulate the sources and data that underpin these LLMs to in/uniFB02uence the models’ output for the attackers’ own purposes.\\nOrganizations should maintain a healthy distrust of \\nLLM-generated material. Grounding decisions on veri/uniFB01ed data–not conjecture or hallucination–will remain the best way to operate in an increasingly untrustworthy information environment.

Introduction\\nThe geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East have deepened in the last few years; Syria is no \\nexception. The crisis is taking many forms, and the cyberspace conflict is intensifying as sides try to tilt the struggle, by exploiting cyber intelligence and exercising distortion.\\nIn the last few years cyber-attacks in Syria have moved into the front line; many activities in \\ncyberspace have been linked to Syria, especially those conducted by the Syrian Electronic Army and pro-government groups.\\nThe Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) at Kaspersky Lab has found new malware attacks \\nin Syria, using new but not advanced techniques to hide and operate malware, in addition to using proficient social engineering tricks to deliver malware by tricking and tempting victims into opening and exploring malicious files. The malware files have been found on hacked activist sites, web pages and in social networking forums.\\nCyber Arabs, an Arabic-language digital security project of the IWPR (Institute for War and Peace \\nReporting), reported four of these samples in March 2014. The same samples were also reported on Syrian Facebook pages (تقنيون لأجل الحريةTechnicians For Freedom): https://www.facebook.com/tech4freedom\\nGiven the complexity of the situation, there are many factors and entities at play  in this event, but \\nfrom the outside these are all largely speculative. Pro-government groups talk about “defense” and opposition activists talk about “offense”. Here, we will only focus on the malware and the facts that have been found during the analysis, presenting only relevant information, in the hope of setting a clear context for this research.'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/KL_report_syrian_malware.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='6\\nTLP: Green For any inquire please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com\\n3. Analysis\\n3.1. Infection Vectors\\nMalware writers are using multiple techniques to deliver their files and entice the victims to run them, \\ncreating an effective infection vector. Mainly depending on social engineering the attackers exploit:•\\nVictims’ trust in social networking forums\\n•Victims’ curiosity in following news related to political conflict in Syria\\n•Victims’ fear of attacks from government\\n•Victims’ lack of technology awareness\\nOnce they have infected the victim’s computer, attackers have full access and control over victim’s devices. In the following section we show different versions of posts sent via popular file sharing sites or social networking platforms. The sample details and domain lists used by the attackers can be found in the Appendices 1 and 2 in the end of the document.\\n3.1.1.

Newer samples were typically found to use “.scr” containers in order to hide malicious files and avoid early detection by security solutions.\\nNew samples\\nMore recent samples, starting from the end of 2013, have shown a more organized development \\neffort, creating highly stealth and graphically-enticing applications.\\nIn this analysis we have seen how Syrian malware has evolved, showing no signs of stopping any \\ntime soon. Even though new malicious Syrian samples are appearing each day, the subset presented here will hopefully give the reader an overall view of the techniques and tools that are currently being used to target Syrian citizens.\\n3.2.1. The National Security Program\\nCuriosity killed the cat: browsing a previously leaked spreadsheet of wanted activists leads to infection.\\nWe found a set of compressed files on a popular social networking site; when, extracted it \\nshowed a database containing a list of activists and wanted individuals in Syria.

With the innocent title of “Ammazon Internet Security”, this malicious application tries to mimic a security scanner, even including a quite thorough graphical user interface and some interactive functionality.\\nAgain, this shows the simplicity of creating a graphical user interface that will trick most of the non-\\ntech-savvy population. Using nothing more than a couple of buttons and a catchy name, Syrian malware groups were hoping that the intended victims would fall for the trap. Analyzing the code interestingly revealed that it has the look--feel of a security application; but, of course, no real security features. While silently executing a remote administration tool when launching this “security suite”, targeted victims were left without their “Ammazon” protection but witha RAT installed.\\nFrom the Windows process list shown in Process Explorer, we were able to see “J. L Antivirus 4.0” \\nexecuting in our system, and through Process Monitor we caught the creation of the “analysis” log file for our fake antivirus. Behind the curtains, a connection is made to a remote host, sending real time information on all our activities — the real cost of this free internet security suite!\\nAmong the many programming methods found inside the source code, we were even able to find \\na “CheckForUpdates” function; and if you look closely enough you can even see “Detection” and “Quarantine” assemblies included in this application. So, not only has a lot of work gone into creating this fake antivirus, the authors also followed good programming practices and implemented modules for each specific (albeit fake) functionality. Maybe at a really quick first sight this could pose as a legitimate tool, but a deeper inspection reveals its true malicious nature.\\n'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/KL_report_syrian_malware.pdf', 'page': 17}, page_content='18\\nTLP: Green For any inquire please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com\\nThe real log file was one where all keystrokes were recorded and later sent from the computer via a TCP \\nconnection. Even though this type of keylogging functionality is nothing new, when we consider how these malicious applications are being used, and the control they give to the attackers, we can start to measure the importance of reporting these threats and providing protection from them.\\nEvidently, the malware authors didn’t care much to provide an option to close the “antivirus”, \\nand if you were to kill the process you would get a nice ‘blue screen of death’ and an unexpected \\nsystem reboot. Surely, the fake application will load  again once everything is back up, creating an \\ninteresting method for guaranteeing persistence.\\n'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/KL_report_syrian_malware.pdf', 'page': 18}, page_content='19\\nTLP: Green TLP: Green For any inquire please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com For any inquire please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com\\n3.2.4. You’ve installed the latest antivirus solution, now let’s “protect your  \\n   network”\\nTotal Network Monitor (which is a legitimate application) was inside another sample we found, \\nused with embedded malware for spying purposes. Offering security applications to protect against surveillance is one of the many techniques used by malware writing groups to get victims who are in desperate need for privacy to execute these dubious programs.\\nAn almost fully functional version of the “Total Network Monitor” utility is included. What this \\nmodified version does not show is the remote connection made to a host where f system information is dumped. The actual infection is performed when first clicking on the installer, which uses obfuscation to hide all malicious activity until the “legitimate” tool is completely installed.\\nAs with other samples reviewed, system persistence is obtained by modifying  Windows start-up registry \\nkeys. Using names such as “Desktop Manager” increases the likelihood for this threat to go unnoticed. However, the entry name “empty” or “empty.exe” should raise a red flag when auditing these keys.\\n3.2.5. Whatsapp and Viber for PC: Instant messaging, instant infection\\nAs with other samples, social engineering does all of the heavy work. Instant messaging applications for desktop operating systems have been used in the past to spread malware and it seems that Syrian malware authors have jumped on the bandwagon. In contrast to the “Ammazon Internet Security”, these samples don’t contain any graphical user interface or even an error message that will tell the victim not to worry about their security. Heading straight for system infection has proven successful for them, and using these popular application names gets the interest of a much larger audience.\\n'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/KL_report_syrian_malware.pdf', 'page': 19}, page_content='20\\nTLP: Green For any inquire please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com\\nThe following screenshot shows how the application name, intended functionality and even the icon \\nused, all work in conjunction to create a believable story for the victim. And this is not a comprehensive list, by any means. Framing and social engineering techniques are playing an essential role in all Syrian related malware threats and the trend suggests that the complexity of them will only keep on increasing.\\n3.2.6. Beware of chemical attacks\\nAnother attack uses social engineering tricks.  The sample 38e3bc8776915dbd2e55a4d90f85a872, named “Kimawi.exe” and with JPG icon, is a RAT file bound to the picture “Kimawi.jpg”.

Kaspersky Lab MENA RAT Statistics\\nRemote Administration Tool (RAT) Trojans are malicious programs that allow a remote “operator” to \\ncontrol a system as if he has physical access to that system. Malicious RATs are widely used by different types of cybercriminals (hacktivists, script-kiddies, and scammers) and even in some state-sponsored attacks.\\nSome of the most popular RATs are detected by Kaspersky products as following:\\n• Trojan.MSIL.Zapchast, also known as Njrat\\n• Backdoor.Win32.Bifrose, also known as Bitfrose\\n• Backdoor.Win32.Fynloski, also known as DarkComet\\n• Backdoor.Win32.Xtreme, also known as Xtremrat\\nThe statistics below, extracted from the Kaspersky Security Network (KSN), show the number of RAT infection attacks blocked by Kaspersky Lab products in the MENA (Middle East North Africa) region in the 2013-2014 period:\\nCountry/Detection Zapchast Bitfrose Fynloski XtremeRAT Total\\nAlgeria 39113 12071 11643 7106 69900+\\nTurkey 6326 3325 14002 3586 27200+\\nKSA 9616 5555 5336 4516 25000+\\nEgypt 5567 5883 4325 2634 18400+\\nIraq 6756 2280 3235 3055 15300+\\nUAE 3594 1165 9244 745 14700+\\nMorocco 4084 2710 3104 1233 11100+\\nLebanon 426 297 8073 136 8900+\\nTunisia 2844 1888 1495 1004 7200+\\nSyria 2806 1897 1362 544 6600+\\nQatar 1332 327 2177 233 4000+\\nJordan 1259 680 1104 414 3400+\\nOman 1241 446 915 374 2900+\\nBahrain 1218 178 1214 254 2800+\\nKuwait 454 407 922 345 2100+'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/KL_report_syrian_malware.pdf', 'page': 33}, page_content='34\\nTLP: Green For any inquire please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com\\nZapchast\\nBitfroseFynloskiXtremeRAT'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/KL_report_syrian_malware.pdf', 'page': 34}, page_content='35\\nTLP: Green TLP: Green For any inquire please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com For any inquire please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com\\nBased on KSN world statistics, the MENA region has one of the highest numbers for RAT attacks, as \\nshown below:\\nCountry Number of users\\nAlgeria 39113\\nIndia 35024\\nFrance 10955\\nSaudi Arabia 9616\\nMexico 6862\\nIraq 6756\\nTurkey 6321\\nEgypt 5567\\nRussian Federation 5526\\nMalaysia 5014\\n• Algeria has the highest number of users facing NjRat infection for the 2013-2014 period and five countries from MENA are in the NjRat top 10\\n• Algeria has the highest number of users facing Xtreme RAT infection for the 2013-2014 period and four countries from MENA are in the Xtreme RAT top 10.\\n• Four countries from MENA are in the Bifrose top 10 infection list.\\n• Three countries from MENA are in the DarkComent top 10.\\n NjRAT infection Top 10s'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/KL_report_syrian_malware.pdf', 'page': 35}, page_content='36\\nTLP: Green For any inquire please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com\\n5. Conclusion\\nSyrian malware has a strong reliance on social engineering and the active development of \\ntechnologically complex malicious variants. Nevertheless, most of them quickly reveal their true nature when inspected carefully; and this is one of the main reasons for urging Syrian users to be extra vigilant about what they download and to implement a layered defense approach.\\nAntivirus software uses either signature or heuristic-based detection to identify malware. On the \\none hand, signature detection searches for a unique sequence of bytes that is specific to a piece of malicious code. On the other hand, heuristic detection identifies malware based on program behaviour. In our research we were able to collect more than 100 malware samples used to attack Syrian citizens. Although most of these samples are known, cybercriminals rely on a plethora of obfuscation tools and techniques in order to change the malware structure so as to bypass signature scanning and avoid antivirus detection. This proves how critical heuristic technologies are when it comes to protecting against these types of attack. By being able to identify variants of known malware types or even new malware families, Kaspersky Lab security products detected all the collected samples.\\nWe expect these attacks to continue and evolve both in quality and quantity. We expect the \\nattackers to start using more advanced techniques to distribute their malware, using malicious documents or drive-by download exploits. With enough funding and motivation they might also be able to get access to zero day vulnerabilities, which will make their attacks more effective and allow them to target more sensitive or high profile victims.\\nEven though the attackers depend mainly on using known RATs, their rapid improvement and \\napplication of obfuscation techniques, GUI development for fake applications, and code modification via automated builders, increase the probability that it won’t be too long before they start writing their own Trojans to take advantage of customized infection capabilities and implement better security evasion.\\nFinally, having a comprehensive and up-to-date antivirus and firewall  should be the first measure \\ntaken by any user that does any type of online activity, especially during these uncertain times when new cyber threats appear almost daily.'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/Innovazione Digitale/Cybersecurity domain/KL_report_syrian_malware.pdf', 'page': 36}, page_content='37\\nTLP: Green TLP: Green For any inquire please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com For any inquire please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com\\nAppendix 1: Samples\\nAll samples table\\nThe list of sample files has been collected through the infection vectors detailed above (Skype, Facebook, \\nfile-sharing, email, etc.).

These are pragmatic, e\\ufb00ective approaches to counter emerging and evolving cyberthreats18Incident Response Report 2024\\\\n18\\\\nSpotlight On: Speed\\\\nClearly, defenders need to speed up as much as possible. We\\u2019ll give more \\\\nrecommendations for how to do that later in this report, but for the moment, there are a few key principles to keep in mind: \\\\n\\u2022  Preparation. One of the best ways to get ahead of attackers is to truly get ahead. \\\\nThrough proactive preparation, organizations can get ready to respond within hours to \\\\ncompromises, stopping attackers before they have a chance to execute their plans.\\\\n\\u2022  Automation. As we mentioned in the Black Basta example above, human security \\\\nteams need to sleep, and they\\u2019re also typically pulled in many directions. Automation\\u2013especially when powered by machine learning and AI\\u2013can help defenders sift through alerts and surface the ones that truly need attention. \\\\n\\u2022  Zero Trust. Another powerful way to limit the damage an attacker can do after \\\\ncompromise is to limit their movement and activity. When organizations design their security posture in accordance with a Zero Trust philosophy, attackers become less powerful when they gain initial access, because initial access means much less. It\\u2019s the di\\ufb00erence between a thief getting into an entryway and being able to move through the entire building, and a thief getting into the lobby only to encounter another locked door. \\\\n\\u2022  Defense in depth. A security program designed with overlapping defenses and \\\\ncontrols gives attackers more opportunity to alert you to their presence. Especially combined with limited privileges in a Zero Trust philosophy, you can raise the signal-to-noise ratio of meaningful alerts that will let you focus on attacker activity earlier in the attack lifecycle.']\",\n          \"['Antivirus software uses either signature or heuristic-based detection to identify malware.

They’re a criminal group focused on /uniFB01nancial gain. They are also one of the most aggressive threat actors in the landscape today. Countering their attacks is a challenge for defenders of small and large organizations alike. This report has a special section on them, including an analysis of what they do and how you can defend against them. \\nOf course, they weren’t the only group in the mix. We also responded to \\ncompromises from other criminal groups, state-aligned actors, and some groups that we don’t know enough about yet to characterize.\\nAnswering this question of “who” is one of the things that Unit 42 Threat \\nIntelligence is great at. We’ll keep researching and uncovering attackers wherever they try to hide. \\nHow Do Threat Actors Get In?\\nIn the past year, attackers’ initial access most often started with a software vulnerability. The largest attack campaigns began with successful exploitation of internet-facing systems. From there, the stories varied. \\nNaturally, we also saw other techniques, from attackers using previously \\nstolen credentials, phishing (both in email and chat), and more. \\nBut don’t be misled–though phishing lost the top spot and dropped to \\nnumber three, it’s still a serious threat. Attackers leverage phishing attacks for access, credentials, and tokens, rather than trying to drop malware. \\nWhat Helped Threat Actors Succeed?\\nThere were three security weaknesses that weren’t themselves the cause of incidents, but made attackers’ lives easier. Address these, and you’ll be helping yourself and hurting them.\\n• Patch management. It’s only a matter of time. Unpatched \\nvulnerabilities on internet-facing systems will be exploited. Measure and \\nreduce your attack surface, and you’ll improve this.\\n• Consistent coverage. Our incident responders found that \\norganizations with partial or incomplete deployment of security controls (especially endpoint detection and response tools) allowed attackers to operate from parts of the network that weren’t defended. Deploy your defenses everywhere, and you’ll deny them this advantage.\\n• Identity and access management. More attackers are stealing and \\nusing the identity of authorized personnel to access and move around networks. Make that harder and embark on or continue a journey toward Zero Trust networking, and you’ll pressure attackers into making mistakes you can see.Actors, Methods and Targets\\nSubscribe NowListen to Unit 42’s\\nWhere we share unique \\nthreat intelligence insights, \\nnew threat actor TTPs,\\nand real-world case studies']</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>['5\\nTLP: Green TLP: Green For any inquire please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com For any inquire please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com\\n2.

These are pragmatic, eﬀective approaches to counter emerging and evolving cyberthreats18Incident Response Report 2024\\n18\\nSpotlight On: Speed\\nClearly, defenders need to speed up as much as possible. We’ll give more \\nrecommendations for how to do that later in this report, but for the moment, there are a few key principles to keep in mind: \\n•  Preparation. One of the best ways to get ahead of attackers is to truly get ahead. \\nThrough proactive preparation, organizations can get ready to respond within hours to \\ncompromises, stopping attackers before they have a chance to execute their plans.\\n•  Automation. As we mentioned in the Black Basta example above, human security \\nteams need to sleep, and they’re also typically pulled in many directions. Automation–especially when powered by machine learning and AI–can help defenders sift through alerts and surface the ones that truly need attention. \\n•  Zero Trust. Another powerful way to limit the damage an attacker can do after \\ncompromise is to limit their movement and activity. When organizations design their security posture in accordance with a Zero Trust philosophy, attackers become less powerful when they gain initial access, because initial access means much less. It’s the diﬀerence between a thief getting into an entryway and being able to move through the entire building, and a thief getting into the lobby only to encounter another locked door. \\n•  Defense in depth. A security program designed with overlapping defenses and \\ncontrols gives attackers more opportunity to alert you to their presence. Especially combined with limited privileges in a Zero Trust philosophy, you can raise the signal-to-noise ratio of meaningful alerts that will let you focus on attacker activity earlier in the attack lifecycle.']</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>12</th>\n","      <td>['Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP) are representations of the behavior or modus operandi of cyber adversaries.\\n\\nSource: https://stix.mitre.org/about/documents/STIX_Whitepaper_v1.1.pdf\\nExploitTargets are vulnerabilities or weaknesses in software, systems, networks or configurations that are targeted for exploitation by the TTP of a ThreatActor.\\n\\nSource: https://stix.mitre.org/about/documents/STIX_Whitepaper_v1.1.pdf']</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>13</th>\n","      <td>['Researching and identifying \\ninfrastructure allows organizations to identify the following: \\nTactical intelligence to use in an ongoing incident response \\neffort, infrastructure used by adversaries before it’s used \\nagainst the organization, and historical context or associations \\nbetween infrastructure and attackers.\\n20 For more details on this investigation, see the RSA report, \"Kingslayer—A Supply Chain Attack\": rsa.com/en-us/resources/kingslayer-a-supply-chain-attack .Figure 29  Links among infrastructure used by APT group\\nSupply chain attacks: One compromised vector can affect many organizations\\nMuch like any enterprise looking to save time and money, \\nattackers seek out ways to make their operations more \\nefficient.

These links may appear to lead to legitimate news sources or videos, but instead, they redirect the user to a malicious website where they are prompted to download and install the malicious app.  In addition to using Trojanized apps, pro-government groups also use phishing emails to infect users. These emails may appear to come from trusted sources such as banks or government agencies, and they may contain links to malicious websites or attachments that contain malware.  Overall, pro-government groups use a variety of techniques to infect users with RATs, including Trojanized apps, phishing emails, and fake news articles or videos. By understanding these techniques, users can take steps to protect themselves, such as being cautious when clicking on links or downloading apps, and keeping their antivirus software up to date.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>\\n\\nThreat actors are individuals or groups who engage in illegal or malicious activities online.

It is designed to collect sensitive information from infected devices, including contact lists, call logs, text messages, and location data. The spyware also has the ability to record phone calls and take pictures or videos without the user's knowledge.  One of the key features of SunBird is its ability to exfiltrate data from popular messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal. This allows the attackers behind the spyware to gain access to private conversations and other sensitive information shared through these platforms. Additionally, SunBird can also steal login credentials for various online accounts, allowing the attackers to gain access to even more personal information.  Overall, SunBird is a highly sophisticated piece of malware that poses a significant threat to users who may be targeted by its creators.

Unlike traditional denial of service attacks, which are typically short-lived and intended to cause temporary disruption, PDoS attacks are designed to permanently disable the target system. One common method of carrying out a PDoS attack is through the use of malicious software known as \"brickers.\" These programs are specifically designed to corrupt or delete critical system files, rendering the target system unusable. In some cases, brickers may also attempt to overwrite the boot sector of the hard drive, making it impossible for the system to start up at all. Another technique used in PDoS attacks is the exploitation of vulnerabilities in the target system's firmware. This can allow attackers to gain remote access to the system and make changes to its configuration, potentially causing it to become unresponsive or even crash entirely. Once a PDoS attack has been successful, the affected system may require extensive repairs or replacement in order to restore functionality. As such, these attacks can have significant financial and operational impacts on organizations that rely on their IT infrastructure for day-to-day operations. To protect against PDoS attacks, organizations should implement robust security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and regular patch management practices. Additionally, it is important to maintain strong password policies and ensure that all user accounts have appropriate levels of access control.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>10</th>\n","      <td>Because of their prevalence, buffer overflows have been a popular target for attackers.

Insufficient resources: Defenders may not have enough resources to effectively monitor and protect their systems, making it easier for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities. 4. Poor communication: Defenders may not communicate effectively with each other or with external parties, leading to delays in incident response and increased risk of data breaches. 5. Inadequate training: Defenders may lack the necessary skills and knowledge to identify and respond to complex attacks, leaving them vulnerable to attackers who are better equipped. 6. Overconfidence: Defenders may underestimate the capabilities of attackers, leading to complacency and a false sense of security.
